It reconciles mixed findings in the literature by highlighting two conditions under which anti-corruption information campaigns are likely to improve electoral accountability: (1) voters have sufficient information about politician performance and (2) voters are not too pessimistic about the quality of the political class. The treatment provided factual information from audits of incumbent performance on Constituency Development Fund spending. Before treatment, public opinion data from Afrobarometer and Ipsos Synovate indicate that Kenyan voters believe that almost all politicians are corrupt. The treatment has no impact on voter beliefs about their own incumbent, but improves perceptions of the political class for voters who find out that their incumbent is clean. The findings suggest that although voter judgments about incumbent performance tend to be fixed, voter pessimism towards the political class does update with factual information.",,,,2013-03-02,2013-03-07,The intervention was embedded within a series of factual SMS messages.

Between June 2011 and January 2013, GiveDirectly distributed unconditional cash transfers to 500 poor rural households. The transfers were sent to recipients' mobile phones using the M-Pesa technology. The present RCT includes three treatments: first, the transfers were randomly chosen to be sent to either the primary female or the primary male member of the household. Second, the transfers were randomly assigned to be sent as either a large lump-sum payment, or a series of nine monthly installments of the same total amount. Third, the magnitude of the total transfer to each treatment household was randomly chosen to be either $300 or $1,100. The outcome variables include expenditure, food security, assets, income and enterprise activity, intrahousehold bargaining, domestic violence, education, health, and preferences, as well as psychological well-being and neurobiological measures of stress. ",,,,2011-06-01,2013-01-31,"The UCT Program implemented by GiveDirectly Inc. (GD) targets impoverished households in Kenya. The study evaluates GD’s intervention in the Rarieda District, in Western Kenya. GD’s intended beneficiaries are especially disadvantaged households, with per capita incomes below $1 per day. Households are identified as eligible using objective and transparent criteria that are highly correlated with poverty: dwellings lacking solid walls, floors, or roofs.

GD’s goal is to provide flexible financial assistance to those in greatest need, while maximizing cost efficiency by transferring cash electronically using M-Pesa mobile money technology, a key innovative feature of the program. M-Pesa is a mobile money system offered by Safaricom, the largest Kenyan mobile phone operator. GD transfers the money from GD’s M-Pesa account to that of the recipient. To facilitate the transfers, GD distributes a SIM card and asks the recipient to sign up for M-Pesa; then, money is transferred to the SIM card, and the recipient can withdraw the balance at an M-Pesa agent by putting the SIM card into the agent's cell phone, or using their own phone. 

This delivery method drastically cuts the costs of reaching the recipient: GD transfers 90% of the program’s total budget directly to a poor household, with the remainder covering recipient identification, including staff costs (7%), and mobile transfer fees for both GD and recipients (3%). Not only is the intervention cheap; the insights from the study can also be applied broadly, as the program can be implemented in any area with access to mobile money technology. As such technology spreads throughout the developing world, the program will become increasingly scalable.","Assets, expenditure, psychological well-being and neurobiological markers of stress, food security, education, health, intra-household bargaining and domestic violence, enterprise",See pre-analysis plan,,,"Evaluation questions 

Our main questions are: (i) What are the overall impacts of UCTs on various dimensions of household welfare? (ii) How should UCTs be structured to maximize impact? In particular, how do outcomes vary with three key, yet understudied, design parameters: recipient gender, transfer frequency, and transfer size? The intervention therefore contains the following treatment arms: 

1. Transfers to the woman vs. the man in the household. First, half of the transfers were made to the woman, while the other half were made to the man. This feature allows us to identify the differential welfare effects of gender-specific cash transfers. 

2. Lump-sum transfers vs. monthly installments. Second, half of the transfers were lump sum, and the other half was paid in 9 monthly installments. By randomizing the month in which the lump sum transfer was made, we kept the discounted present value of the lump-sum and installment transfers similar across the overall lump sum and monthly installment groups.

3. Large vs. small transfers. Finally, a proportion (28%) of the transfers were $1,100 in magnitude, while the remainder were $300. This manipulation allows us to estimate the effect of transfer magnitude on welfare outcomes. 

These three treatment arms are fully crossed with each other, except that the $1,100 transfers were made to existing recipients of $300 transfers in the form of a $800 top-up that was delivered as a stream of payments after respondents had already been told that they would receive $300 transfers. The pre-analysis plan outlines how this issue is dealt with in the analysis. 

Evaluation Design 

Sampling and Identification strategy 

To establish a causal relationship between the program and changes in outcomes, this study uses a Randomized Control Trial (RCT). We first identified Rarieda as an intervention area because it has (i) high poverty rates according to census data, and (ii) sufficient M-Pesa access to make transfers feasible. We then identified 100 villages based on the overall prevalence of eligible households in the village. In these villages, we identified 1,500 eligible households, with eligibility determined by residing in a home made of mud, grass, and other non-solid materials. These criteria are simple, objective, and transparent, maximizing accountability. The criteria were not pre-announced to avoid “gaming” of the eligibility rules. We then randomized on two levels -- across villages, and within villages. Specifically, 50 villages were randomly assigned to be treatment villages, while the other 50 were pure control villages. In each of the latter, we surveyed 10 households that did not receive a cash transfer. Within treatment villages, we conducted a within-village randomization: 50% of eligible households were randomly assigned a cash transfer; the other 50% received no transfer (GD will seek to make transfers to this group after the study). This strategy allows us to identify spillover effects (detailed in the pre-analysis plan). 

Spillover effects 

We use three approaches to quantify spillover effects. First, we used pure control villages to quantify within-village spillovers. Comparing control households in treatment villages to those in pure control villages identifies within-village spillover effects. Second, we identify spillover effects across villages. Note that these effects could potentially be even more pronounced than within villages, if, for instance, entire villages are affected by weather shocks. Using GPS data on village location, we can identify cross-village spillovers, under the assumption that these spillovers are geographically correlated. Third, a separate village-level survey elicited general equilibrium effects of the intervention at the level of the local economy; we surveyed residents of the village on prices, labor supply, wages, crime, investment, community relations (e.g. perceived fairness of targeting criteria) and power dynamics. 

Data collection methods and instruments 

Data was collected at baseline and one year after the intervention. A midline with a subset of questions was administered to a sample of respondents each month after the intervention. Trained interviewers visited the households; both the primary male and the primary female of the household were interviewed (separately). Surveys were administered on Netbooks using the Blaise survey software. Following standard IPA procedure, we performed backchecks consisting of 10% of the survey, with a focus on non-changing information, on 10% of all interviews. This procedure was known to field officers ex ante. Saliva samples were collected using the Salivette (Sarstedt, Germany), which has been used extensively in psychological and medical research, and more recently in randomized trials in developing countries similar to this one. It requires the respondent to chew on a sterile cellulose swab, which is then centrifuged and analyzed for salivary cortisol. 

Power calculation 

The sample size of 500 individuals in each of the treatment, control, and pure control conditions was chosen based on a power calculation, which showed that a sample of 1,000 individuals is sufficient to detect effect sizes of 0.2 SD for all treatment vs. pure control households with 89% power. Different treatment arms within the treatment groups (male vs. female recipient, lump-sum vs. monthly, large vs. small transfers) can be compared with 60% power. 

Risk and treatment of attrition 

Attrition was not a significant concern in this study because it became evident early on in GD’s work in Kenya that respondents were highly interested in maintaining relations with GiveDirectly in the hope of receiving future transfers (although these are never promised). Nevertheless, we used five approaches to control attrition. First, the survey contained a detailed tracking module developed by Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), the NGO implementing the fieldwork. IPA and GD collaborated closely throughout the study to facilitate tracking. Second, we incentivized survey completion through a small appreciation gift (a jar of cooking fat); in addition, respondents earned money from the economic games in the survey. Third, in our power calculations, an attrition rate of 20% would still result in a power of 80%. In fact, we only observed 3% attrition between the two visits of the baseline. Finally, we control for attrition econometrically in the analysis, as detailed in the pre-analysis plan.",,Computerized randomization in office.,household (treatment vs. spillover households) and village (treatment/spillover vs. pure control villages),100 villags,1500 households,"500 households treatment, 500 households spillover, 500 households pure control","0.2 SD, 80%","Name: University of Zurich, Department of Economics Institutional Review Board

The randomization was conducted at the level of the polling station. For each treatment, there were two different sub-groups of polling stations: (i) polling stations where all individuals who had registered at the polling station and had provided a phone number were treated, and (ii) polling stations where a random half of the individuals who had provided a phone number at registration were treated (this adds some individual randomization within this set of polling stations). 

Treatment 1: Voters received generic mobilization messages encouraging them to vote on Election Day.

Treatment 2: Voters received a message about each of the five positions aside from President (Member of National Assembly, Senator, Governor, Ward Representative and Women's Representative) and were reminded of the significance of each of the positions.

Farmer behavior in light of these fluctuations is often puzzling: the vast majority appear to sell their produce when prices are low, buy when prices are high, or often both. This behavior appears to persist despite farmers’ general recognition of these price patterns, and the availability of a simple technology - storage - which can be used to move grain intertemporally.

Why don’t farmers use storage to take better advantage of these seasonal price fluctuations? Working with 1589 smallholder maize farmers and an NGO implementing partner in Webuye District in Western Kenya, we designed and implemented an experiment to test two hypotheses: (1) farmers are liquidity constrained and thus sell their maize at low post-harvest prices because they need the cash, and (2) farmers’ friends and family make frequent claims on stored maize, reducing the incentive to store.",,,,2012-10-01,2013-08-15,,"maize inventories, maize prices paid and received, maize revenues, and consumption expenditure",,,,"Farmers were divided into two main treatment groups (an October loan group and a January loan group), and a control group.

",,,,2009-02-01,2010-07-31,"The study will evaluate two HIV/AIDS prevention strategies among youth in Kenya either alone or combined.  Specifically, the following interventions are being evaluated: 

Intervention 1: Voluntary Counseling and Testing for HIV (VCT)
VCT is a critical entry point for access to HIV/AIDS treatment and care, and is being scaled up in many countries. But VCT could also be a powerful prevention tool. By providing personalized counseling as well as information about high-risk behaviors, VCT could motivate people to adopt safer sexual behavior and prevent transmission of HIV. This could be particularly important for adolescents and young adults, who typically have had their sexual debut but might not have perfect information about HIV risk. They are often still HIV-negative, and might be better able to change their sexual behavior.

Intervention 2: Distribution of free condoms
Despite strong evidence of the biological effectiveness of the male condom as an HIV prevention strategy, condom use continues to remain low in many countries. Several factors, such as low availability, cost, lack of education about condoms and how to use them, and relationship factors contribute to low usage.  This study examines whether free and easy access to a large quantity of condoms can result in a reduction of risky behaviors and a decline in transmission of STIs among youth.","Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV-2) prevalence, HIV knowledge, attitudes and behaviours",,,,"The study is an unblinded, individually randomized controlled trial.

This program “differs from conventional business training materials by highlighting essential entrepreneurial skills from a gender perspective, whether applied to starting or improving an individual, family or group business. It addresses the practical and strategic needs of low-income women in enterprise by strengthening their basic business and people management skills. It shows women how to develop their personal entrepreneurial traits and obtain support through groups, networks and institutions dealing with enterprise development” (Bauer et al, 2004).  The program began in Thailand in 2001, and over the next decade was used in 18 countries around the developing world. 
An objective of the program is to create a “business mind” among low-income women engaged in small-scale businesses. The training methodology is participatory, with practical exercises to teach concepts. For example, women learn about the different types of costs involved in production, and how to account for their own costs through making lemonade; have role play exercises to practice different sales strategies for customers; and make necklaces to discuss a production process and the importance of different factors in product design. 
Topics covered included several gender concepts that tend not be emphasized in general business training programs such as: the difference between sex and gender, and the role of cultural constraints in shaping women in business; dividing household and business tasks; and how to network with other women and the role of women’s associations. In addition, it covers a number of topics more typical of standard programs such as recordkeeping and bookkeeping; separating business and household finances; marketing; financial concepts; costing and pricing; generating and fine-tuning new business ideas; setting smart objectives; and traits needed for business success.

Then within each market, Individuals were assigned to treatment (be invited to training) or control (not be invited to training) within treated markets by forming four strata, based on quartiles of weekly profits from the census (<=450, 451-800, 801-1500, 1501-4000), and then assigning half the individuals within each strata to training.

In Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, recent nationwide surveys show that large majorities of children are unable to read or do arithmetic at the required level (Uwezo at Twaweza, 2011). While the challenges facing the education sector are well known, existing reforms and aid instruments have largely failed to improve the situation.

At present, the two main approaches used by governments to improve the quality of education in East Africa are to strengthen teacher training and to disburse a capitation grant for books and related activities to schools. On the former, several studies show formal levels of teacher qualification to be weakly correlated to performance. On the latter, it is difficult to establish the impact of capitation grants on improving learning outcomes because the full amounts of the grant have not consistently reached schools and because they have not been rigorously evaluated. At the same time, even if funds were to flow well, under current arrangements no one is held accountable or incentivized to achieve learning. The lack of adequate attention to accountability and incentives may in part explain why increased budgets for education have not resulted in improved learning outcomes. So while government programs have largely focused on providing educational inputs, recent evidence suggests that it may be more effective to incentivize the delivery of learning outcomes, particularly at the local level (see Glewwe and Kremer 2005, and Kremer and Holla 2009).

In short, we see three key challenges to improving education in East Africa: (1) how to consistently get resources to the lowest (school/community) levels, (2) how to effectively invest (government and donor) resources by gearing the education process to emphasize learning outcomes rather than educational inputs, and (3) how to generate rigorous evidence of what works and have it inform national education debate, policy and practice. 

In this project we seek to evaluate the impact of two separate approaches to improving early grade learning outcomes. We seek to evaluate the impact of providing schools with extra resources in the form of capitation grants (a grant per child enrolled) and the impact of providing teachers with incentives to achieve foundational learning outcomes in early grades (teachers receive a small bonus for each student that achieves an appropriate learning outcome). In addition we will evaluate the combination of the two approaches (i.e. capitation grants and teacher incentives).

The evaluation is being implemented in 350 government primary schools in 10 districts in Tanzania between 2013 and 2014.

",2013-03-07,2015-02-28,"Treatment Group 1, Capitation Grant (70 schools): In this group the capitation grant (CG) program, as dictated by the Tanzanian Ministry of Education and Vocational Training, is implemented at each school. Each school receives a grant of 10,000Tsh/student, delivered in two tranches, one in March and one in July. This treatment focuses on making the existing policy work by channeling funds in full and more effectively to primary schools, and to test the effects of basic information provision about the grants. The evaluation will seek to measure the extent to which the funds reach schools, the level of citizen engagement on the use of funds, and ultimately the impact of funds and information on improving learning outcomes. In 2013, the average CG distributed to schools was 7,646,429Tsh.

Treatment Group 2, Cash on Delivery (70 schools): In this group teachers of Kiswahili, English and Math in Grades 1, 2, and 3 are eligible to receive 5,000Tsh per student that passes a given subject test at the end of the year, for a total of 15,000Tsh possible per student. Teachers are not penalized for students who do not pass.

Treatment Group 3, Combination (70 schools): Schools in this treatment group are given both the Capitation Grant and Cash on Delivery intervention.

All interventions were implemented directly by Twaweza and it’s District Partners, with money given through the CG and COD interventions coming also from Twaweza. Within each intervention, information describing the intervention was distributed to schools and the communities via school and community meetings in early-2013. The District Partners then followed up with additional school visits in July and August to answer any questions regarding the program. All students in Grades 1, 2, and 3 in schools in Treatment Groups 2 and 3 were tested in Kiswahili, English and Math at the end of the school year to determine teacher incentive payments. Tanzanian education professionals, following a similar structure as the Uwezo annual learning assessment, developed the subject tests for Grades 1, 2, and 3. The same schedule will be followed in 2014. ","The main outcome variables are students test scores, as a proxy for student learning. Assuming we are able to establish that the treatments had an impact in students test scores, secondary outcome variables would try to establish spillover effects, the mechanisms behind the main treatment effects and how the treatment effects vary across student, household, teacher and school characteristics.

A sample of 30 students per school (10 students from Grades 1, 2, and 3) are to be tested in all treatment schools and in 140 control schools. Students will be tested before the intervention begins, at the end of the first year and at the end of the second year. The information of these test will be used to calculate standardized test scores and compare achievement for children across treatment groups. We also collect detailed student information  (e.g.  age and gender); detailed school information (e.g. facilities, management practices and head teacher characteristics), detailed teacher information (e.g. education, age, experience and self reported time use), and detailed household information (e.g. parents engagement in child's education, parents own education, household composition, and assets owned by the household).  

The information from our household, teacher and schools survey can be used to identify the mechanisms through which the treatment affects test scores. For example, we can look at the change in learning outcomes in non-incentivized subjects; how teachers spend their time in school; how schools spent the funds of the Capitation Grants (e.g. text books, scholarships, meals, etc); whether schools increased the hours taught in the incentivized subjects; and whether household become more or less engaged in the child's education after the intervention. Using the base line survey we can study how the treatment effects differ across student, household, teacher and school characteristics.","The main outcomes variables will be standardized test scores. First, we will construct a standardized test score for each subject in each grade, by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the test scores in the control group. Once we have subject-grade standardized test scores, we will add these up across grades and the re-normalize (dividing by the standard deviation of the test scores in the control group); this will yield subject standardized test score. 

For some analysis we will also aggregate test scores across subjects by summing them and the re-normalizing (dividing by the standard deviation of the test scores in the control group).",,,"This evaluation was conducted in 350 schools in 10 randomly selected districts across Tanzania. All government primary schools were eligible in each of the 10 districts, but 35 schools were randomly selected from each district to be part of the evaluation. The probability that a school was chosen was proportional to the number of students enrolled in the school. In each sampled district, 14 schools were assigned to the control group and 7 schools were assigned to each treatment group, CG, COD and Combination. 

The aims of the three treatment groups are as follows:
1. Capitation Grant (CG): Test the impact of providing capitation grants (while providing the community with information on these grants) on improving basic literacy and numeracy.
2. Cash on Delivery (COD): Test the impact of incentivizing teachers to achieve previously set, absolute levels of learning among students in Grades 1, 2, and 3.
3.

Out study attempts to alleviate these two constraints through an intervention involving the provision of mobile banking savings accounts that are labeled for specific goals including unexpected/emergency expenses.  The use of labeled savings accounts has been shown to be effective at increasing savings, with speculative evidence pointing suggesting that labeled savings accounts induce mental accounting.

There is now a unique opportunity to increase rural energy access through grid connections. This study explores the opportunity to increase rural energy access through grid connections. We utilize a randomized controlled trial to examine: 1) the demand for grid connections in rural areas, 2) the cost economies associated with mass connections, and 3) the social and economic impacts of grid power.

",,,,2014-04-28,2014-08-31,"In partnership with the Rural Electrification Authority (REA), our team of researchers will distribute national grid connection subsidies of varying amounts to randomly selected unconnected households in rural parts of Western Kenya.

There will be three levels of subsidies: (1) high value subsidies equal to $412, (2) mid value subsidies equal to $235, (3) low value subsidies equal to $118. 

The randomized encouragement design will allow researchers to generate exogenous variation in electricity connections. In the first stage of the project, the intervention will allow researchers to: (1) trace out the demand curve for electricity connections in order to better understand the price at which the majority of Kenyans would connect to the grid, and (2) trace out the economies of scale in costs resulting from coordinated (grouped) connections. In the second stage of the project, the intervention will allow researchers to measure the social and economic impacts of electrification. The remainder of this text will focus on describing the first stage of this project.","The following are the key outcome variables of interest in the first stage of the project:

1. Demand: Different levels of subsidies will create random variation in the effective prices faced by rural households. By comparing take-up rates at different prices, researchers will be able to trace out a demand curve for grid connections.

2. Costs: Different levels of subsidies will create random variation in the number of households applying for power at the same time. By connecting multiple households at the same time, utilities can experience significant economies of scale in transport, design, and low-voltage line costs. We will therefore estimate the effect of increasing scale (i.e. number of applications) on the average connection cost per household.

To measure the direct impact on program participants, the research conducts two surveys of participants in the second wave of a micofranchising program being implemented by in six Nairobi neighborhoods. The two surveys comprise: a baseline survey of applicants who will subsequently be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups or a control (non-treated comparison) group and an endline impact evaluation survey of up to 2000 women who complete the baseline survey.

To measure the indirect impact on pre-existing businesses, the research project also includes an enterprise census and a monthly enterprise survey.  The census will identify businesses operating in the sectors and neighborhoods of interest, a subset of whom will then be invited to join the enterprise survey.

Attempts to reduce these risks through insurance contracts have typically been unsuccessful due to low take-up rates. In this project, we work with one of the largest private sector contract farming schemes in East Africa, investigating what constrains the take-up rate and testing innovative insurance schemes for contract farming settings. This project will consider the role of inter-temporal distortions in constraining take-up.

The theoretical justification for insurance is as a transfer across states, not across time: the welfare gain arises through shifting consumption from good states, where the marginal utility of consumption is low, to bad states, where it is high. However, standard insurance contracts work by the payment of a premium ex-ante for an ex-post state dependent payout. That is, real world insurance contracts combine state dependent payouts with saving, rather than with other state dependent payouts. Insurance shifts risk from those from whom it is more costly to those for whom it is less costly, but in its standard formulation these welfare improvements are partly offset by shifting saving from those for whom it is likely to be cheap to those for whom it is expensive.

The most likely reason for the standard ex-ante payment is enforcement. An insurance contract which is just a transfer across states with no ex-ante payment is unlikely to be incentive compatible: in the absence of enforceable contracts, as may be the case in many rural agricultural settings, in good states the insured would not pay the insurer. Contract farming offers a potential solution to this, thus allowing insurance to be offered without a transfer across time. Since the farmer and buyer enter a contract (typically enforced on the side of the farmer through the buyer having a monopsony) the buyer can provide inputs on credit to the farmer, with the cost reclaimed with interest from the harvest revenue of the farmer. Currently, the partner company offers several inputs (e.g., land preparation, fertilizer) to farmers in this way, enabling them to solve the challenge of increasing levels of fertilizer use in Kenya. Similarly the buyer can offer insurance with the premium paid on credit (or, equivalently, in the form of a flatter payment schedule).

The proposed research will investigate whether demand for insurance with ex-post premium is higher than traditional insurance and if so, which of the possible mechanisms / inter-temporal distortions are important in constraining demand in this setting. It will do so by randomly offering either ex-post premium or standard insurance to farmers and then observing the difference in take up rate.",,,,2014-08-25,2015-02-28,"The main aspect of the treatment to be randomized is whether the insurance offered by the partner contract farming company is paid for up front or on credit.. The insurance on credit is identical to the standard insurance, except the cost (plus interest at the standard rate for other inputs) is agreed to be borne as a deduction from the farmer's revenue after harvest. We will study the impact of offering the insurance through deduction and compare this effect to the effect of a large reduction (about 30%) in premium when paying upfront.

The insurance offered has a double trigger design. Payment occurs only if both farmer's individual yield is low and the local average yield is low. The triggers are based upon an econometric model using historical data.

[POST-TRIAL AMENDMENT, 4/17/2018:] In addition to the main experiment, we also run two smaller experiments, with 120 farmers each. In the first, we cross cut the insurance on credit treatment with a cash drop. In the second, farmers chose between a cash payment and free enrollment in the insurance. One half of farmers received their choice immediately, whereas the other half of farmers received their choice in one month's time.","Our primary analysis will test the difference in take-up of insurance with upfront payment (at actuariall fair and discounted premium) vs. payment through deduction. 

We will also look at heterogeneity of take-up by each of the following covariates. 

- Rate of intertemporal substitution of income and time inconsistency of this rate.
- Wealth (land ownership, number of cows)
- Index of trust toward the company (index 1-4)
- Percentage difference between subjective expected yield and yield predicted by the model
- Yield of last cycle
- Subjective likelihood that the plot will be in debt at the end of the cycle.

If any of these variables presents a particularly skewed distribution, we will report the heterogeneity by the trimmed variable or by deciles

In addition, if the take-up in the upfront insurance with actuarially fair price and that with discounted premium are similar, we will bundle these two treatments to maximize power on the heterogeneity analysis.",,,,"We study take-up of agricultural insurance in a sample of approximately 600 sugarcane contract farmers. 

Plots are randomized in three treatment groups
1. Insurance with actuarially fair premium paid upfront
2. Insurance with premium equal to 70% of the actuarially fair value paid upfront
3. Insurance with actuarially fair premium (+interest) paid through deduction at the end of the cycle

[POST-TRIAL AMENDMENT, 4/17/2018:] In addition to the main experiment, we also ran two smaller experiments, with 120 farmers each.  In the first small experiment (``cash drop experiment’’), we cross cut the insurance on credit treatment with a cash drop, worth approximately the value of the insurance premium. Each cross-cut treatment group comprised about 30 farmers. In the second small experiment, 120 farmers chose between a cash payment, equal to the insurance payment, and free enrollment in the insurance. One half of farmers were told they would receive their choice immediately, whereas the other half of farmers were told they would receive their choice in one month's time. Both small experiments had the same randomization method as the main experiment (described in the Experimental Design Details below).

",,"Farmers invited to the meeting are assigned random numbers. Attended farmers are entered into an attendance list in order of this random number. A randomization sheet, pre-generated for each field, is used to assign treatment based on the attendance list. ",Individual farmer,600 sugarcane plots,600 plots,Approximately 200 plots in each of the three groups. If the take up rates for the upfront 100% and 70% of the actuarially fair treatments are similar in the beginning of the trial we may reduce their sample sizes slightly in order to increase the sample size of the deduction group.,"In pilot data, in the treatment group where the insurance is offered with upfront premium payment at an actuarially fair value, the take-up is around 10 percent (s.d. 0.35). With sample size of 200 plots per group (upfront actuarially fair vs. deduction payment vs. upfront discounted), we have a minimum detectable effect of around 10 percentage points. Note that these calculations do not take into account field fixed effects and therefore, as long as field have predictive power, are likely to be conservative

At the time of registering the first version of this trial, we do not have reliable data on the power of the regressions by baseline covariates. This will depend on i) the distribution of the covariates in the population of interest; ii) the impact of the covariate in the cash group. We will report power calculations for these heterogeneous effects in an appendix and will only report the heterogeneities for which we have power in the main paper.

GiveDirectly identifies villages in which they are willing to work, and in order to facilitate research on cash transfers, these villages are randomly assigned to treatment or control status. Within treatment villages, GiveDirectly then identifies all households that meet their eligibility criteria, enrolls and verifies the eligibility of eligible households, and sends cash transfers to all eligible households via the mobile money system M-Pesa.

These two marketing channels are radically different from the point of view of the farmers: small traders pay prices higher than the larger buyers and pay farmers in cash (rather than through consolidated transfers at the end of the month). We work in partnership with a large dairy cooperative in Kenya and propose a set of experiments to understand how interlinked transactions explain this prevailing market structure.

Using a comprehensive baseline survey, we hypothesize farmers face saving constraints and have a demand for deferred and bulky payments. Only large organizations, with enough reputation, can provide saving service through deferred payments. On the other hand, farmers do not trust small traders to hold their money. We propose several experiments to test this hypothesis.

We offer selected members of the coop the option to be paid more frequently than the coop currently does. In a first treatment, we ask farmers to chose whether they want to be paid daily for their milk deliveries to the coop - as opposed to continue being paid monthly as the coop currently does. We offer a price increase to those farmers that switch.

In a second treatment, we offer farmers the choice between continue being paid monthly versus having the flexibility to chose, every day, whether they prefer their deliveries to be paid in cash or at the end of the month. In both cases, we increase prices paid for a subset of their deliveries deliveries. 

In a third experiment in which farmers are assigned to a short-run bonus for a subset of their milk deliveries with either monthly or flexible payments (as in the second choice experiment described above) for short periods of three days each. 

We also hypothesize that farmers adopt a rule of thumb rule where they use their morning milk for savings and their afternoon milk for liquidity and consumption. In order to test with hypothesis, we plan to elicit preferences for monthly vs. daily payments for morning and afternoon.

Finally, we conduce lab-in-the-field experiments to test whether buyer credibility affects farmers' preferences for daily/monthly payments. We also test whether buyer's saving constraints matter.

The main outcomes of interest are take-up of more frequent/flexible payments in the choice experiments, intertemporal choices in the am vs. pm, and milk deliveries to the coop in the bonus experiment.",,,,2014-10-06,2017-07-31,"The interventions consist of 2 choice experiments and 1 incentive experiment.

This problem is most serious in Sub-Saharan Africa, where according to the World Health Organization, 26% of preschool children are estimated to be deficient. One effective and low cost solution to fight VAD is to introduce a biofortified staple food crop that is rich in vitamin A, such as the beta-carotene-rich orange fleshed sweet potato (OFSP). Although, sweet potato is one of the major staple food crops for many African countries, its production is dominated by white, yellow or cream colored sweet potato varieties that have very low vitamin A content. Clearly, greater effort is needed to scale up the adoption of OFSP and achieve the potential nutritional benefits of this technology. Scaling Up Sweet Potato Through Agriculture and Nutrition (SUSTAIN) is a project led by the International Potato Center (CIP) with support from the U.K. Department for International Development designed to achieve precisely this goal. It builds on recent advances in the biofortification of sweet potato and proof-of-concept research to deliver the benefits of OFSP to millions of farming households and thousands of urban and rural consumers in Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, and Rwanda. 

Achieving “impact at scale” is at the heart of the SUSTAIN project. Concomitant to the goal of achieving ‘impact at scale,’ is the SUSTAIN project’s desire to deliver the production and nutrition benefits to millions of people effectively and efficiently. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) is designed to provide an objective and independent evaluation of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the SUSTAIN project’s scaling up approach so as to support and facilitate the innovation process within the project, and to learn from it for future expansion. The RCT focuses on one SUSTAIN country -- Rwanda, where the project has set a goal of reaching 60,000 direct beneficiaries and 250,000 indirect beneficiaries by taking an integrated agriculture-nutrition-marketing approach. This integrated approach consists of implementing following components/strategies of promoting OFSP production, sale, and consumption in eight target districts across the Northern, Southern and Eastern Provinces in Rwanda: 

1.	Agriculture: The agriculture component includes two sub-components—vine distribution and agronomic training. The project plans to distribute vines of improved OFSP varieties to households with children less than 5 years old or with pregnant women. About 100 vines each of two selected improved varieties will be distributed free of cost to eligible households, followed by a second round of vine dissemination in the third season to the same households, but at a subsidized cost which will be a fraction of the normal cost. These beneficiary households will be targeted through farmer organizations or farmer field schools (FFS). Under the agronomic training sub-component, all the members (men or women) of the farmer organization or the farmer field school that will be targeted by the project for vine distribution will receive agronomic training on growing OFSP at the time of vine distribution and during the growing season.

2.	Nutrition: This component encompasses two strategic elements or sub-components—messaging and counseling. All the members of the farmer organization or the farmer field school (men and women), and pregnant women and lactating mothers who visit the local health facilities will receive nutritional ‘messages’ on the importance of OFSP as a source of vitamin A, which is essential for good health, and how OFSP as part of a balanced diet contributes to vitamin A intake. The nutrition ‘counseling’ sub-component will include incorporating the promotion of OFSP consumption in the on-going nutrition education curriculum of the community health worker and health center. In this counseling component, the emphasis will be on 'doing', 'demonstrating' and 'showing' rather than simply telling/informing about OFSP. All the women and caregivers in the village with children less than 5 years and pregnant women will be targeted for the counseling sub-component of the nutrition intervention. The SUSTAIN project will link the nutrition component with the planned and ongoing health and nutrition activities implemented by the Rwanda Ministry of Health through the health centers and community health workers (CHWs).

3.	Marketing:  The marketing interventions will include two sub-components—training and market linkage. All the members of the farmer groups and FFS that received vines will also receive in-depth (but context specific) training (delivered several times during the project phase) on how to process OFSP, market it, meet the demand for roots quality, and organize finances. Under the market linkage sub-component, the SUSTAIN project will actively promote the linkage between OSFP growers and processors and other actors in the value chain. This sub-component will focus on a proactive action by the project to find processors willing to work with farmers and then equipping the farmers with knowledge, tools and skills to ensure they meet the processors’ requirements in terms of roots quality and delivery schedules. CIP / SUSTAIN project implementers will work with groups/cooperatives and FFS in this component, but marketing is expected to take place at the household level.

This evaluation study in Rwanda uses a randomized-controlled trial (RCT) field experiment to test the effectiveness of different combinations of this integrated agriculture-nutrition-market approach of promoting the adoption and consumption of OFSP at scale. The research design consists of randomly assigning project villages to one of the following six treatment arms:

1.	Base model: All the components of the integrated Agriculture, Nutrition and Marketing approach
2.	Base model less nutrition counseling

These treatment arms are designed to include or exclude project components and sub-components that substantially differ in projected cost and benefits. Costs include both financial resources and human/institutional capacity to reach the target number of beneficiaries. Given SUSTAIN’s resource constraints, the goal is to maximize the number of beneficiaries (direct + indirect) per unit of cost. The benefits of the project are measured on two dimensions – a) by the total number of beneficiaries reached/impacted (i.e., the extensity dimension); and b) the average effect per beneficiary as measured by the adoption and consumption of OFSP by children, women and men three years after the project intervention (i.e., the intensity and sustainability dimension).

This RCT is designed to address the following research questions:
1.	Which combinations of market promotion and nutrition information dissemination are most cost effective for promoting production and consumption of OFSP by a large number of beneficiaries (scale) to meet their nutritional needs (intensity) over time (sustainability)?  
2.	Which factors are important in determining OFSP adoption by farmers, and their consumption among children and women? Do the different promotion strategies influence them differently? 
3.	How do the effects of various project components involving training and knowledge dissemination (e.g., nutritional information, market information) differ across different recipient and household characteristics (e.g., gender, age, education of recipient of training and of household head)?

The plan is to collect baseline and end-line data from a sample of project beneficiaries across all six treatment arms. In order to capture potential spillover effects (e.g., farmer to farmer sharing of vines and adoption of OFSP by households who were not directly targeted by the project), researchers will also collect some basic information for all households in selected treatment villages for this RCT in listing (or census) exercises both at baseline and end-line. This beneficiary level data in combination with cost tracking data to be collected by the project monitoring and evaluation team will be the bases for addressing the research questions identified for this evaluation.

The survey data will contribute to conducting a rigorous evaluation of SUSTAIN project interventions across a range of outcome indicators. These indicators include: adoption of OFSP, consumption of OFSP by children less than 5 and women of child bearing age (especially, pregnant and lactating women), frequency of foods rich in vitamin A, dietary diversity and history, infant and young child feeding practices, sweet potato production and productivity, market penetration, cost-effectiveness of scaling-up mechanisms and not least, gender outcomes and impacts. By measuring these indicators before and after project intervention, we will be able to assess how effective SUSTAIN strategies are in: improving the consumption of foods rich in vitamin A by children under age 5 and women of child bearing age; improving dietary diversity; encouraging planting of OFSP; encouraging consumption of OFSP; increasing incomes of farmers who sell OFSP in markets; and increasing agricultural production.
",,,,2014-12-01,2018-08-01,"The SUSTAIN project interventions consist of implementing the following components/sub-components under an integrated agriculture-nutrition-marketing approach of scaling up the dissemination of orange fleshed sweet potatoes (OFSP). This is referred as the 'Base model' in the RCT design.

1.	Agriculture: The agriculture component includes two sub-components—vine distribution and agronomic training. The project plans to distribute vines of improved OFSP varieties to households with children less than 5 years old or with pregnant women. About 100 vines each of two selected improved varieties will be distributed free of cost to eligible households, followed by a second round of vine dissemination in the third season to the same households, but at a subsidized cost which will be a fraction of the normal cost. These beneficiary households will be targeted through farmer organizations or farmer field schools (FFS). Under the agronomic training sub-component, all the members (men or women) of the farmer organization or the farmer field school that will be targeted by the project for vine distribution will receive agronomic training on growing OFSP at the time of vine distribution and during the growing season.

2.	Nutrition: This component encompasses two strategic elements or sub-components—messaging and counseling. All the members of the farmer organization or the farmer field school (men and women), and pregnant women and lactating mothers who visit the local health facilities will receive nutritional ‘messages’ on the importance of OFSP as a source of vitamin A, which is essential for good health, and how OFSP as part of a balanced diet contributes to vitamin A intake. The nutrition ‘counseling’ sub-component will include incorporating the promotion of OFSP consumption in the on-going nutrition education curriculum of the community health worker and health center. In this counseling component, the emphasis will be on 'doing', 'demonstrating' and 'showing' rather than simply telling/informing about OFSP. All the women and caregivers in the village with children less than 5 years and pregnant women will be targeted for the counseling sub-component of the nutrition intervention. The SUSTAIN project will link the nutrition component with the planned and ongoing health and nutrition activities implemented by the Rwanda Ministry of Health through the health centers and community health workers (CHWs).

3.	Marketing:  The marketing interventions will include two sub-components—training and market linkage. All the members of the farmer groups and FFS that received vines will also receive in-depth (but context specific) training (delivered several times during the project phase) on how to process OFSP, market it, meet the demand for roots quality, and organize finances. Under the market linkage sub-component, the SUSTAIN project will actively promote the linkage between OSFP growers and processors and other actors in the value chain. This sub-component will focus on a proactive action by the project to find processors willing to work with farmers and then equipping the farmers with knowledge, tools and skills to ensure they meet the processors’ requirements in terms of roots quality and delivery schedules. CIP / SUSTAIN project implementers will work with groups/cooperatives and FFS in this component, but marketing is expected to take place at the household level.
","The outcome indicators of interest in this experiment are: adoption of OFSP, consumption of OFSP by children less than 5 and women of child bearing age (especially, pregnant and lactating women), frequency of foods rich in vitamin A, dietary diversity and history, infant and young child feeding practices, sweet potato production and productivity, market penetration, cost-effectiveness of scaling-up mechanisms and not least, gender outcomes and impacts.",,,,"The research design consists of randomly assigning project villages to one of the following six treatment arms:

In the first stage, 42 sectors are randomly selected based on stratification (at the province level) by population density (grouped as low, medium and high density sectors). In stage 2, six villages are randomly selected from each sector (using simple random sampling, SRS method), and randomly assigned to one treatment arm.

The TVVP is a randomized evaluation of a youth training intervention in Kenya. In 2008, participants of an ongoing longitudinal data collection effort known as the Kenyan Life Panel Survey (KLPS) were invited by a local non-governmental organization to apply to receive a voucher to cover the cost of vocational training.  2,163 young adults between the ages of 18 and 30 submitted an application, and a randomly selected half of applicants (1,055 individuals) were awarded a voucher while the other half served as the comparison group. Furthermore, a random half of all TVVP introductory meetings included an additional intervention – a presentation on the returns to vocational training, highlighting in particular the opportunity for women to learn traditionally male-dominated trades, which in many cases are more lucrative. We refer to this as the “information intervention”. 

TVVP voucher winners subsequently enrolled in training for varying lengths of time during 2009-2011 at any of 65 different public and private training institutions in rural and urban locations across Kenya. Data was collected from participating individuals and training institutions during the enrollment period, and near term follow-up data was collected from TVVP program applicants between August 2011 and August 2014.

In 2013, the SCY program was launched utilizing this same sample of individuals, such that a randomly selected half of TVVP voucher winners and half of non-winners were awarded unconditional cash grants worth approximately US$230 each.

This plan outlines our evaluation questions, outcomes of interest, and a proposed econometric approach.",,,,2011-03-01,2013-04-30,"Context
The study worked with a very particular sector in Kenya, the informal sector, commonly known as the “Jua Kali” (literally meaning “under the hot sun”) sector (Orwa 2007). The artisans, vendors, and mechanics in this sector face extreme vulnerability to illness, economic dislocation, and natural disasters. Yet, employment in Jua Kali increased by 5.1 million in 2002, accounting for 74.2 per cent of total non-farm employment, according to Kenyas Central Bureau of Statistics. The Jua Kali sector encompasses small-scale entrepreneurs and workers who lack access to credit, property rights, training, and good working conditions. JKA workers supply goods to local markets using predominantly manual labor and little capital, often making do with handmade tools. Their workshops and stands frequently lack electricity and running water. These workers are organized into various sheds built out of metal sheets that give little protection from the elements. Given the extreme health hazards that they face, Jua Kali workers can stand to benefit from insurance schemes that provide coverage in the event of workplace accidents.

Micro-Health Insurance
Subjects receiving insurance enrolled in the CIC Afya Bora plan, a combined inpatient and outpatient family health insurance policy. These treated households received inpatient benefits of up to KSH 250,000 per family that covered the costs of:
• Hospital accommodation charges for a general ward bed in contracted hospitals • Doctor and healthcare professional fees
• Prescribed routine lab tests
• X-ray and ultrasound tests
• ICU, HDU, and theatre charges
• Prescribed medicines, dressings, and internal surgical appliances
• Routing diagnostic lab tests
• Day care surgery
• Maternity including non-elective caesarean section with 6 mo. waiting period
• Chronic and pre-existing conditions up to KSH 75,000
Households also received outpatient benefits of up to KSH 50,000 per family that
covered:
• Routine outpatient consultation
• Diagnostic laboratory and radiology services
• Prescribed medicine and dressings
• HIV/AIDS related conditions and prescribed ARVs
• Routine immunizations
• Routine prenatal check ups
• Postnatal care up to six weeks after delivery
• Pre-existing and chronic conditions up to KSH 20,000 • Outpatient oncology
• Psychiatry and psychotherapy
Beneficiaries paid KSH 100 for each outpatient visit. Both covers included chronic and pre-existing conditions, including HIV/AIDS but excluded treatment outside Kenya, cosmetic treatment, treatment by non-qualified persons, infertility, self-inflicted injury, ex- perimental treatment, and dental treatment unless occassioned by accidental injury. Ben- eficiaries could access these benefits through CIC’s network of providers that included 26 mission and faith based hospitals in Nairobi.
The plan provided benefits to principals and spouses under 72 years old and children dependents younger than 25 years with proof of enrollment in school or college. Subjects were enrolled in the Afya Bora plan free of charge for one year, a value of KSH 12,745 for the principal, spouse and up to five dependents. Each additional child dependent increased the annual premium by KSH 2,000 per child. The project fully reimbursed households for the base cost and any added premium.

Unconditional Cash Transfer
Subjects in the second treatment group received an unconditional cash transfer equal to the net value of the annual premium they would have had to pay had they enrolled in the CIC Afya Bora scheme. The transfer was delivered to recipients electronically using the M-Pesa mobile money service. M-Pesa is a mobile money system offered by Safaricom, the largest Kenyan mobile phone operator. Using M-Pesa requires a registered SIM card and a valid Kenyan national ID card. The project transfered the money from Innovations for Poverty Action Kenya’s (IPA-K) M-Pesa account to that of the recipient. To facilitate the transfers, we encouraged recipients to sign up for M-Pesa and helped them obtain, where necessary, all of the requirements for registration. The cash was transferred to the registered SIM card wirelessly and the recipient could withdraw the balance at an M-Pesa agent by putting the SIM card into the agents cell phone or by using their own phone.","Please see attached pre-analysis plan.

Only adult JKA members who work in an area of Kamukunji Jua Kali that makes him or her eligible for voting rights with the JKA were eligible to participate in the research. We ran a preliminary survey including 1,392 JKA members between August 2008 and December 2010. We also ran a pilot study between Feburary 2010 and December 2010 to test the questionnaire and identify potential difficulties in the scale-up of the project.
After the census, the subjects were randomly stratified into three income groups ac- cording to household weekly income. 313 subjects with a weekly income greater than KSH 4,000 comprised the high income group. 300 subjcts with a weekly income between KSH 2,000 and KSH 4,000 comprised the middle income group. 242 subjects with a weekly income under KSH 2,000 comprised the low income group.

The design was chosen as hygiene interventions have been shown to do more good than harm, thus it will be more ethical to ensure that all schools selected for the study eventually benefit from the intervention rather than doing nothing in control schools (Brown and Lilford, 2006). This approach will also allow a robust comparison of the effects of the intervention on handwashing behavior among schools with and without exposure to the intervention.
Based on logistical consideration and budgetary implications, we will randomly select 30 schools and divide the schools into 3 groups of 10 schools each.  After baseline data collection in all schools at the beginning of the study, the intervention will be initiated in successive groups.

In Kenya, 25% of currently married women are not using a contraceptive method, despite having no current intention to become pregnant, signifying a high unmet need for contraception (KDHS 2008).  Contraceptive discontinuation has been identified as a major factor influencing high levels of unmet need, with more than one in three contraceptive users in Kenya discontinuing use within 12 months of method uptake (KDHS 2008). In recent literature, contraceptive discontinuation is associated with low-quality family planning counseling, including lack of information about common side effects and strategies for dealing with side effects and danger signs. A mobile phone-based platform to deliver enhanced contraceptive method-specific information and to improve ease, quality, and quantity of counseling for new family planning users will explore a unique mechanism to support contraceptive continuation among low-income women in Nairobi. The intervention is comprised of a set of SMS counseling and informational messages aimed specifically at the method type chosen by new family planning users, with interactivity that will allow for nurses to call clients regarding specific counseling needs. Through a randomized controlled design, the study will evaluate the impact of the enhanced SMS-based counseling program on adherence to routine follow-up, contraceptive continuation, satisfaction, and knowledge about side effects and common myths and misconceptions surrounding contraceptive use.

Each message with conclude with an encouragement for the participant to send a reply SMS for free to receive a phone call from a nurse. Message content has been developed to reinforce clinical protocols on facility-based side effects care and counseling provided to follow-up family planning clients at the partner hospital sites. Specific message streams have been developed for each of the following types of modern contraceptive methods: intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD), hormonal implants, oral contraceptive pills (both combined and progestin-only), progestin-only injectable, and male condoms. Message order for each stream is based on literature on side effect timing and prevalence, as well as local partner's clinical experience.

Follow up surveys will be administered at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year. The first follow up survey will be cross randomized at 3 months with study arms: clients who will receive the first follow up survey at 3 months postpartum and clients who receive their first follow up surveys at 6 months postpartum.

Women between 18 and 40 years old are eligible for inclusion if they have sought care at a Jacaranda Health facility and obtained a new method of family planning, defined as a method that the client was not using directly prior to her consultation. Women must provide a phone number by which they can receive SMS message and phone calls.","Eligible participants will include clients obtaining a new method of modern contraceptive methods (defined as IUCD, implant, oral contraceptive pills, hormonal injectables, or male condoms) for immediate uptake at one of the local partner's maternity facilities located in Kenya’s Kiambu county. A “new” method in this case is defined as a method that the client was not already currently using at the time of her consultation at Jacaranda. Clients receiving follow-up or continuation care (i.e. a client returning for a routine hormonal injectable or additional supply of oral contraceptive packets) will not be eligible for enrollment. Additionally, clients who wish to obtain a method but were not able to based on contraindications or medical eligibility criteria reasons will not be eligible if they are not able to obtain the method at the time of the Jacaranda consultation. Furthermore, although this has not been previously observed at Jacaranda facilities, clients obtaining methods with the intent to delay use (for example, pregnant women aiming to obtain a method for use after delivery) will not be eligible. Eligibility will not be limited to postpartum women (defined as women who have delivered in the past 1 year), with nulliparous, primiparous, and multiparous women eligible for participation if other eligibility criteria are.","Randomization will be conducted using reproducible code (using STATA software). Randomization is not stratified, but is rather simple random randomization using patient ID numbers assigned by the partner organization sequentially by time of first visit to the facility.",The unit of randomization is the individual. ,0 clusters. All clients will be recruited at maternity hospitals operated by the local partner organization.,The relevant sample for our SMS intervention will be 600 women.,We aim to enroll equal groups of 300 women in the control and intervention arms.,"We use two primary outcomes of interest in order to calculate power. Our first outcome is the probability of discontinuation by 6 months, defined as the percentage of women who are not using the original method (method adopted at enrollment) for a continuous period of 6 months. Using Jacaranda’s administrative data, we assume that the method mix at original uptake will reflect Jacaranda family planning clients since October 2013. We thus assume that 10% of our sample will obtain pills (combined or progestin-only), 1.4% male condoms, 28.8% injectables, 41.8% implants, and 18% IUCDs. Assuming an exponential decay in contraceptive continuation and using discontinuation probabilities from the Demographic and Health Surveys, we assume an average probability of discontinuation by 6 months in a sample using this method mix to be 11.9% (KDHS 2008/2009; Ali, Cleland, and Shah 2012; FHI360). We would then have 80% power to detect a decrease in discontinuation at 6 months of 6 percentage points. This change would represent a decrease in the overall probability of discontinuation at 6 months to 5.5%, which would represent a significant reduction in discontinuation. We believe this reduction is plausible, given 50-80% of discontinuation is due to the same types of method-related problems (such as dissatisfaction, inconvenience, side effects or health concerns) that our intervention aims to address (Ali, Cleland, and Shah 2012). 

Our second outcome is receipt of follow-up care related to contraceptive use by 6 months. Currently, 19% of Jacaranda’s family planning clients return for a second family planning consultation. With 600 women in our study, assuming equal groups of 300 women, we will have 80% power to detect an increase in the probability of returning for care with 6 months of use of 9% points. This change would represent a significant improvement in contraceptive follow-up care, and is believed to be feasible given similar effects sizes on appointment follow-up caused by mHealth reminder interventions in Kenya (Odeny et al. 2012).","Name: AMREF Ethics & Scientific Review Committee

In one treatment group, we offer free health insurance to small-scale farmers in Kenya.

Our primary hypothesis is that health insurance will engage people in higher-health-risk higher-return activities. Our secondary hypothesis is that the second intervention increases trust in the product, and thus take-up and risk-taking behavior despite the absence of any subsidies.",,,,2011-01-06,2012-04-01,"Subsidy

In this treatment group, we offer free (or 90% subsidy) health insurance. In the privacy of people's homes, we 1) deliver and present an NHIF brochure containing all relevant information about the product, 2) explain the very basic concept of insurance with a cartoon, 3) offer assistance to register (filling the form and sending it on their behalf to NHIF). Note that participants still had to visit our office with the proper documents (national identification card for all adults and birth certificate for all children) for us to organize the rest of the registration.

Informal group meetings

For other randomly selected households, we organize meetings for them and their existing informal group. The intuition of our intervention is that close friends who have themselves experienced a reimbursement by NHIF are best placed to reinforce trust in NHIF. As one of our respondents put it: ""I have no previous experience with insurance, but I have a friend who has NHIF. When that man's wife fell ill, NHIF paid the bill in full. Therefore, I trust the company and understand how it works"". To find these close and respected friends, we use existing social networks in the following way.
To the general audience of the group meeting, we offer the same information and assistance to register as in the subsidy intervention. No subsidies are offered. We do not incentivize early adopters to talk. This intervention merely provides an environment in which to share a positive experience about NHIF.

Information

To verify whether trust in the product can be increased by the informational content delivered in the meetings, in another location, we delivered the same information to other households on an individual basis (brochure, cartoon, and assistance to register as in the groups)

For the ""informal group meeting"" intervention, we randomly select 186 households living in another location (an administrative subdivision of radius 2 hours by foot). We ask them to identify the most important social group that they belong to (e.g., ROSCAs, clan or family groups, church groups). Upon approval by the chairperson (obtained in 92 percent of the cases), we then organize a presentation at the usual meeting time and place of the group.
For the information intervention, we randomly select 389 households. 
Two control groups are considered. First, we consider the 283 households living in the same location as participants receiving an informal group meeting. Despite them not being invited to a meeting, it is possible that some of them attend. This is due to the fact that they belong to the same group as our participants. This group thus measures the potential spillovers inherent in organizing group meetings. Second, 359 households from another location formed a ""purer"" control group. They live much farther from the treatment group. This control group received no other interventions.",,Randomization done in office by computer,Individual randomization.,"The treatment is not clustered.

This is enough to detect the massive returns due to pesticide or cattle growing. Pesticides can double yields (Behera and Singh (1999). In qualitative interviews, farmers from this area report that a 5 months bull is worth 8,000 to 10,000 Ksh, while a 3 year bull is worth 60,000 to 100,000 Ksh. In the conservative case of 60,000 (/12 months / average household size of 3.7)=1,351Ksh/month. These sample sizes are thus sufficient to detect the returns to these high-return technologies.","Name: Microinsurance for the poor

The project will survey approximately 1,500 children of the 7,500 respondents in the Kenya Life Panel Survey (KLPS), creating the new KLPS-Kids dataset, to estimate the extent to which a health program can help break the intergenerational transmission of poverty.",,,,2015-05-15,2017-12-31,"In 1998, a local non-governmental organization (NGO) launched a program known as the Primary School Deworming Program (PSDP) to provide deworming medication to individuals enrolled in 75 primary schools in Busia District, a densely-settled farming region of rural western Kenya adjacent to Lake Victoria. The schools participating in the program consisted of nearly all rural primary schools in Budalangi and Funyula divisions in southern Busia district, and contained more than 30,000 pupils at the start of the study. Baseline parasitological surveys conducted by the Kenyan Ministry of Health indicated that these divisions had high rates of helminth infection at over 90%. Using modified WHO infection thresholds (Brooker et al., 2000b), roughly one-third of children in the sample had “moderate to heavy” infections with at least one helminth at the time of the baseline survey, a rate not atypical by regional standards (Brooker et al., 2000a). The 1998 Kenya DHS indicated that 85% of children in western Kenya, in the relevant age range of 8-18 years, were enrolled in school – suggesting that the sample was broadly representative of western Kenyan children as a whole at the time.

The 75 program schools were randomly divided into three groups (Groups 1, 2, and 3) of 25 schools each: the schools were stratified by geographical area (division, then zone), the zones were listed alphabetically (within each division), and then within each zone the schools were listed in increasing order of student enrolment, and every third school was assigned to a given project group. Due to the NGO’s administrative and financial constraints, the schools were phased into the program over the course of 1998-2001, and the order of phase-in was randomly determined, creating experimental treatment groups. This prospective design is central to the present study’s analytical strategy. Group 1 schools began receiving free deworming in 1998, Group 2 schools in 1999, while Group 3 schools began receiving the drugs in 2001. The project design implies that in 1998, Group 1 schools were treatment schools while Group 2 and 3 schools were the control, and in 1999 and 2000, Group 1 and 2 schools were the treatment schools and Group 3 schools the control, and so on. In 2002 all schools received free treatment. Children in Group 1 and 2 schools thus received two to three more years of deworming than Group 3 children, and these early beneficiaries are what we call the deworming treatment group (parents) in the present study. Deworming drugs were offered twice per year in treatment schools. Analysis during the first two years of the intervention show large, positive gains in height, self-reported health and school attendance of the program beneficiaries (Miguel and Kremer 2004).","Our key outcome variables will be separate domains of cognitive development (including sequential processing and short-term memory, visual-construction ability and spatial relationships), language, fine motor skills, socio-emotional development, and height.",,,,"The project will survey a randomly selected subset of approximately 1,500 children aged 3-5 of 7,500 adult respondents in the Kenya Life Panel Survey (KLPS), creating the new KLPS-Kids dataset. The original KLPS sample contains Kenyans who participated in an earlier health study, known as the Primary School Deworming Program (PSDP). The PSDP provided deworming medication to primary school students in rural western Kenya starting in 1998, where the order of phase-in to primary schools was randomized. Previous research finds that this intervention had substantial positive impacts on the health, schooling and labor market hours and earnings of beneficiaries 10 years after the launch of the program. These impacts on parents are a necessary pre-condition for studying later impacts among recipients’ children, and to estimate the extent to which a health intervention can help break the intergenerational transmission of poverty by improving life outcomes for program beneficiaries’ children. In order to measure the impacts on the recipients’ children, this project will create locally appropriate versions of both standard and innovative survey instruments designed to measure various domains of development among children aged 3-5.

From surveys:
- savings behavior (formal and informal)
- transfers (intra- and inter-household)
- expenditures
- food security
- business investment
- farm investment
",,,,"Sampling Frame
This study took place in the catchment area of banks in three market centers in Western Kenya. A census of all households in these catchment areas was carried out between August and September 2009. The census survey collected information on demographic characteristics of the household, sources of income, as well as access to financial services, knowledge and perceptions of available financial services, and saving practices. A total of 1,898 households were surveyed during the census exercise. Only 20% of these households had a member with a bank account, despite the fact that the average distance to the closest deposit-taking financial institution was (by design) only 1.6 kilometers, suggesting that physical access was unlikely to be a limiting factor. Account ownership was predominantly male: 21% of men had a bank account, against only 10% of women.

Of the 1,898 households in the census, about half (989) were selected to participate in the study. Those households excluded from the study were those with at least one bank account holder (20%), and relatively atypical households, i.e. polygamous households (8%) and households with no female head (11%). Of the 989 sampled households, we could survey both (when applicable) households heads in survey round 1 in 931 cases, and again in at least one of the following rounds in 885 of the cases. Our analysis sample thus consists of 885 households for whom we have at least one follow-up survey round.

Randomization
Out of the household sample, we created a sample of household heads. This individual-level sample included either one or two individuals per household: the female head for single female-headed households, and both the female and male head for dual-headed households. We then randomized these individuals into treatment and control groups. The randomization was done in May 2010, after stratifying the sample by household composition (single female-headed or dual-headed), primary occupation, and market center. Note that the randomization was conducted at the individual, not the household level. Thus, among dual-headed households, while there are households in which either, both, or neither spouse got the account, the size of each group was determined by chance -- and consequently, the four groups are not equal sized. Table A1 shows the final breakdown of households in our analysis sample. Among dual-headed households, 17% had no one assigned to the treatment, 33% had both heads assigned to the treatment group, 26% had only the female head assigned to treatment and 24% had only the male head assigned to treatment. Among single female-headed households, 50% were assigned to the treatment group.

Savings accounts
Individuals selected for the treatment received a nominal, non-transferable voucher for a free savings account. As mentioned above, the study took place around three market centers. In one of these market centers, both the Village Bank and the Commercial Bank have a branch, and the voucher was redeemable at either bank. In the other two market centers, only the Village Bank had a branch, so respondents in those markets were given a voucher redeemable only at the Village Bank. The experiment waived all account opening and maintenance fees, but did not cover any withdrawal fees. In total, the subsidy amounted to $5 for accounts at the village bank and $2.50 plus $0.60 a month for maintenance at the commercial bank. The commercial bank account came with a free ATM card. 

The vouchers were delivered to people in their homes between late May and early July 2010. During that visit, individuals received information on how the banks and accounts worked, and when and how to redeem the voucher. Upon opening the account, individuals could choose to open the account jointly with their spouse or alone. Sixty-nine percent of vouchers that were distributed were redeemed. Only 5.7% of accounts that were opened were joint accounts.",,"Randomization was done in office by computer, using Stata.","Randomization was done at the individual level, but most of the analysis was performed at the household level.

Does exposure to the concept of atheism affect religiosity? We test in a laboratory study in Kenya whether exposure to arguments of the style made by the “New Atheists” impact selfreported and implicit religiosity measures. The present documents outlines the analyses to be conducted to answer this question.",,,,2015-04-25,2015-06-15,"Manipulations
The primes used for the study consist of short video presentations (in English) and a writing task in which subjects are asked to summarize the main point of the primes. There are three conditions: emotional anti-religious argument, rational anti-religious argument, and control. Each prime is approximately 4 minutes long and consists of a speaker making various points about religion, or in the case of the control, about vegetables. The speaker is the same Kenyan narrator in all three videos. Bullet points summarizing the main arguments appear on the screen, accompanying the auditory presentation by the speaker. In the emotional condition, the speaker argues that any God must be very cruel if he allows so many people in the world to suffer, concluding that it is unlikely that God exists. In the rational condition, the speaker argues that the existence of God is unnecessary to explain the universe given our scientific knowledge. In the control condition, the same speaker instead argues that it is important to eat vegetables every day. After viewing the video presentations, participants are asked to summarize the main arguments in their own words by typing into a text box on their screen and then asked a series of questions to ensure comprehension. we will include analyses restricted based on comprehension as described below. The primes were randomly assigned within each session, with approximately 1/3 of participants in each condition. The setup of the lab included dividers between computers so that subjects were unaware of the images shown on the screens of others. Additionally, all subjects wore headphones, so they were unaware of what other participants were hearing. All images used in the implicit religiosity measure (described below) were vetted for comprehension by the experimenters and were further validated through debriefing after several pilot sessions.","1. Self-reported religiosity
Self-reported religiosity is one of our two main outcome variables of interest. Following Shariff, et al (2008), we ask a series of 6 questions intended to gauge religiosity. Individuals are asked to rate the extent they agree with each of the following statements on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5
(strongly agree):
 My personal religious beliefs are very important to me;
 My religion or faith is an important part of my identity;
 If someone wanted to understand who I am as a person, my religion or faith would be very important to that;
 I believe strongly in the teachings of my religion or faith;
 I believe in God;
 I consider myself a religious person

2. Implicit religiosity
Implicit religiosity is one of our two main outcome variables of interest. We employ a single-target Implicit Association Test (ST-IAT) adapted from (but not identical to) the design used by Shariff et al.(2008). The ST-IAT is a computer-based sorting task that uses response time to measure unconscious associations with a target concept. In each block of the ST-IAT, subjects sort three categories of words to the left- and right-hand sides of the screen: synonyms of “real”, synonyms of “imaginary”, and words associated with religion. All language used in the task was vetted for comprehension with the sample population during several pilot sessions. In one block, the subjects sort the religious words and synonyms of “real” to the same side. In a second block, the subjects sort religious words and synonyms of “imaginary” to the same side. The order in which these two blocks occur is randomized. The ST-IAT design assumes that subjects will more quickly sort target words to the side that represents their implicit association with the target. As a manipulation check for the ST-IAT, we also administer ST-IATs using alternatively the names of cartoon characters familiar to most Kenyans and the names of natural landmarks in Kenya. We hypothesize that individuals should be relatively faster to associate cartoons with the concept imaginary and faster to associate natural landmarks with the concept real.

3. Cantril Ladder
To assess how religion may influence an individual’s sense of status, we present participants with a Cantril ladder, which asks participants where they would rate their current life compared to the best possible life they can imagine for themselves, both now and in five years by indicating where they stand (will stand) on a picture of a ladder with steps labeled 0 to 10.

4. Tolerance
We adapt a series of questions from the World Values Survey asking participants “Of the following groups of people, which would you not like to have as neighbors?”
 Drug addicts
 People of a different race
 People who have AIDS
 Immigrants / foreign workers
 Homosexuals
 People of a different religion
 Atheists/people with no religion
 Heavy drinkers
 Unmarried couples living together
 People who speak a different language

5. Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)
To assess the possible effect of the primes on affect, individuals complete questions from the PANAS evaluating negative affect after viewing the primes. On a scale of 1 (not at all) to 100 (very much), subjects are asked “How much do you feel...”
 “Distressed, at this moment?”
 “Upset, at this moment?”
 “Guilty, at this moment?”
 “Ashamed, at this moment?’
 “Hostile, at this moment?”
 “Irritable, at this moment?”
 “Nervous, at this moment?”
 “Jittery, at this moment?”
 “Scared, at this moment?”
 “Afraid, at this moment?”
 “Frustrated, at this moment?”
 “Stressed, at this moment?”

6. Demographics
We ask individuals to report their gender, age and religious affiliation.","Self-reported Religiosity:
We evaluate the impact of priming on each of the questions individually, and test for joint significance using Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR). In addition, we will analyze a weighted-average index based on the methodology in Anderson (2008). Finally, we will also examine impact of priming on any latent factors identified using factor analysis restricting the analysis to factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 and using a varimax rotation.

Implicit Religiosity: 
Using the result of the ST-IAT described above, for each individual we will calculate a D-score as the difference between the mean latency when associating the target concept with the concept ""real"" and the mean latency when associating the target concept with the concept ""imaginary"" divided by the pooled standard deviation. Latency (response time) is recorded in milliseconds and shorter latency indicates a stronger implicit association. A lower D-score represents a stronger belief in the validity of religious concepts. 

Following the recommendations in Greenwald, et al (2003), we will exclude participants for whom more than 10% of responses are below 300 ms, as well as all responses over 10,000 ms. Individuals who initially respond incorrectly in a trial are required to press the correct response before proceeding to the next trial. We measure latency as the total time from beginning the trial to the entry of a correct response, effectively penalizing incorrect responses with longer latencies (Greenwald, Nosek, and Banaji 2003). To check the robustness of our results, we will also analyze the reports using the approach of Lowes et al. (2015). Instead of dropping responses over 10,000 ms, we will winsorize reponse times to 3,000 ms and replace response times for trials that were initially incorrect with the block mean response time plus the block standard deviation.

Cantril Ladder: We will calculate z-scores for responses to both the present-date and 5-year Cantril ladder question.

WVS Tolerance: We will analyze individual responses and test joint significant with SUR regression; in addition, we will calculate both aggregate and weighted average indexes across all responses.

PANAS: We will evaluate whether priming impacted affect by analyzing individual responses and testing for joint significance with SUR regression; in addition, we will analyze the summary indices of this measure. We will also use PANAS results as a dimension of heterogeneity.",,,"1.  Sampling
The study was conducted at the Busara Center for Behavioral Economics (Busara) in Nairobi, Kenya, a facility specially designed for social science studies. Busara maintains an active subject pool of more than 7,000 Nairobi residents. For the present study, 318 subjects who had previously signed-up to be part of the Busara subjet pool were recruited from local universities using SMS and phone calls and were informed that they would be paid KES 300 (approx. USD 7.20 PPP)1. Subjects were told that they were invited to participate in a study about their behavior and preferences. Recruitment was limited to university students to ensure comprehension of the arguments contained in primes. Restricting participation to University students also ensures comprehension English. Although Universities do not typically require an official test of English proficiency, matriculating students are expected to be proficient in written and spoken English, and much of the instruction is in English. Additionally, Busara has confirmed through previous studies that the vast majority of Kenyan university students are highly proficient in English. The sample includes 183 males and 133 females. All subjects were over 18 years of age, with a mean age of 22 and a maximum age of 26.

To control for heterogeneity in religious background, we restricted the sample to Christians by omitting individuals identified as ethnically Nubian from recruitment. Since most Muslims in the Busara subject pool belong to this ethnicity, we believed this to be the best way to identify Christians while avoiding any issues of self-selection that might arise by asking individuals their religion before participation. As described below, 24 individuals in the study either failed to report a religion identified as “no religion” or identified as “other,” and 2 individuals identified as Muslim. We will control for this fact by restricting our analysis as described below.

2. Experimental Procedure
After receiving a text message inviting them to participate in the study, individuals came to the Busara lab in Nairobi, Kenya, for experimental sessions lasting approximately one and half hours. Each session included up to 25 participants. Sessions were administered by two female Kenyan research assistants, who spoke English and Swahili fluently and were trained in helping subjects with comprehension. The experiment was conducted in English. 

Subjects were randomly assigned to one of 25 computer workstations with partitions on three sides, so that they were unable to see or speak with the other subjects. Within each session, individuals were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. All of the treatments and measures were implemented on HP TouchSmart 310 desktop computers running Windows 7. Each participant wore headphones and watched the video prime on his or her own computer. Subjects used the touch screen exclusively to mitigate effects of individual differences in experiences using a mouse and keyboard. All treatments were implemented using z-Tree software (Fischbacher 2007).

For example, in 2009-10, 31\% of total bilateral aid by the OECD Development Assistance Committee's members were in support of gender equality, and approximately 10\% were in support of education (OECD, 2012). The awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize 2014 to Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzay ""…for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education"" also emphasizes the importance of these two issues. It is generally assumed that by targeting women, their children will benefit. However, the evidence in the literature is mixed. In this project, we want to contribute to the literature by studying whether women invest more in their children than men do and what the potential reasons for this might be.

The research questions are the following:
1. Is child welfare influenced by whether additional resources to the household are allocated to women or men?
2. What are the underlying mechanisms determining resources spent on children in the household?

The results from the study will provide insights on both research questions and inform the development policy debate about how to strengthen child welfare. They will also contribute to the economic theoretical literature on household models.

Concerning the first research question, many studies have shown that there is a relationship between gender and household expenditures. To illustrate, in Kenya and Malawi, Kennedy and Peters (1992) find that female-headed households spend a larger share of total income on food and a smaller share on alcohol compared to male-headed households. Similarly, Hoddinott and Haddad (1995) use data from Côte d'Ivoire and find that when the female income share in the household is increased, the share of household income spent on food increases, and the share spent on alcohol and cigarettes decreases.

The assumption that women spend more resources on their children than men leads us to the second research question: What are the mechanisms determining the amount of resources spent on children? First, women and men may have different preferences. If women assign a higher weight to children's welfare in their utility function, they will allocate more resources to their children than men. Similarly, if women are more patient than men are, they will be more willing to invest in their children as this investment yields a long-term return. On the other hand, if women are more risk averse than men, they will be less willing to invest in their children than men as this investment is risky. Second, the difference might be due to bargaining power. Assume that women and men care equally much about their children. In a situation where the men have all the bargaining power and hence make all the decisions, they have to bear all the costs of investing in their children, whereas both adults in the household benefit. Increasing female bargaining power implies that the cost of investing in the child is split between the two adults, and the benefit remains the same for both. In this case, investment in children would increase (Basu, 2006). 

The theoretical framework of this project derives from household models. In the literature, household models are divided into two categories; unitary and non-unitary household models. In unitary household models, the household is considered as one unit maximizing a single utility function (Lundberg and Pollak, 1996. As this model has several limitations, we will focus on non-unitary household models. In particular, one cooperative model and one non-cooperative model. The cooperative model we use is the collective household model developed by Chiappori (1992) and Browning and Chiappori (1998). This approach relies on two assumptions; there exists a stable decision process  in the household and this process leads to Pareto-efficient outcomes (Browning, Chiappori and Weiss, 2014). By using this framework, Basu (2006) finds that children in a household is less likely to work if the power structure is balanced. The non-cooperative household model used in this project is developed by Browning and Lechene (2001). In this approach, agents chose their strategies simultaneously and independently. Each individual act as an independent agent conditional on the action of the other. In other words, the individual maximizes his or her utility subject to his or her budget constraint taking into account the actions of his or her spouse. The solutions need not be Pareto efficient (in the sense that it may be possible to improve the utility of one of the spouses without reducing the utility of the other spouse). In this case, going from a situation in which the woman has no bargaining power to a situation in which the woman has some bargaining power, will decrease investments in children.

To answer the research questions, we have designed a lab experiment to be conducted in the field in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. We have invited married couples with at least one child of primary school age to the lab in July and August 2015. The experiment will consist of three parts. In the first part we elicit time and risk preferences (incentivized choices) to study whether men and women have different preferences for investing in children. In the second part of the experiment, the participant will make an incentivized distributive choice. The choice they make is an allocation between themself, their spouse and their child (1/3 of participants make this decision on their own, 1/3 bargain over the decision with their spouse and 1/3 simply observes their spouse's choice). The idea here is to experimentally vary female bargaining power to investigate whether an increase in female bargaining power causally changes how much is invested in the child. In the third part of the experiment, the participants will answer four non-incentivized questions about the decision-making in their household. These questions are intended to measure bargaining power within the household.

Consumer theory offers predictions about the impact of such programs on wellbeing and spending behavior, but there is little real-world evidence. In this paper, we outline the pre-analysis plan for a randomized field experiment to explore the effect of welfare program design on these two key outcomes. We specifically test three design features: 1) workfare versus welfare; 2) restricted versus unrestricted vouchers; and 3) voucher messaging with a focus on spending on oneself or on others. The ten-day experiment involved 432 individuals living below the poverty line in the Kawangware settlement of Nairobi, Kenya. Each day, subjects either sorted lentils or waited in a room for benefit payments, provided as vouchers to a local grocery store. We either restricted the vouchers to certain basic food items or did not restrict them, and we also randomized voucher messaging. We outline the analysis plan of the impact of these experimental treatments on happiness, productivity, and consumption decisions.",,,,2014-09-22,2014-10-03,,"Outcomes I: Expenditures

During the course of the experiment, PBK accepted the vouchers distributed during the experiment and redeemed the value of the vouchers for any item (or the set of restricted items), according to the instructions on each voucher. Vouchers were labeled with ID numbers reflecting the individual’s unique identifier, the treatment group, and the date of issuance in a manner that was not transparent to subjects.

Every time a subject paid for his/her purchases with vouchers, PBK Nonic Supermarket staff stapled the receipt to the voucher. Next, a Busara research assistant with experience conducting randomized field experiments and familiarity with the local culture reviewed the vouchers and attached receipts for errors. The research assistant then collected all vouchers at the end of the day and returned them to the Busara office. 

Participants could redeem their vouchers anytime from the start of the experiment until a week after the experiment concluded. This timeline gave participants up to three full weeks to redeem their vouchers. Through this partnership with PBK Nonic Supermarket, we were able to track the proportion of the vouchers spent on essential versus non-essential goods, along with the voucher type (Self or Family, conditional or unconditional), amount spent, date redeemed, and other information associated with the subject. This data served as basis for the analysis on consumption. 

Outcomes II: Baseline, Daily, and Endline Surveys 

Three survey types were administered during the study. First, on the initial day of the study, participants completed a Baseline survey. The Baseline survey asked questions related to people's current emotions (using a PANAS scale), weekly spending habits, employment, household characteristics, familiarity with the PBK Nonic Supermarket, and decision-making power within the household. 

Second, every day of the study after the initial day, participants completed a Daily survey that asked the same “current emotions” questions from the Baseline survey, but did not include the additional questions in the Baseline survey. 

Third, at the end of the study participants completed an Endline survey, which asked a series of questions on self-esteem, general happiness, and optimism. The Endline survey was designed to measure overall life satisfaction and wellbeing, rather than incidental happiness, enabling us to distinguish between “fleeting” effects of the treatments on wellbeing as opposed to longer run effects on disposition. The Endline survey also asked about family dynamics, income levels, how subjects approached spending the vouchers, and how they felt about their consumption decisions. 

Outcomes III: Effort and Worker Productivity

Two measures of effort and productivity were collected. First, for all treatment groups, attendance and timeliness was tracked by on-site field officers. Second, for the Work treatment only, the productivity of each worker was measured by: 1) weighing of the amount of lentils and rice sorted in the work period; 2) keeping track of the precise time spent sorting for each subject; and 3) computing grams sorted per minute as a proxy for productivity/efficiency. ",,,,"Subjects
The subjects in this experiment were 432 individuals living in the Kawangware area of Nairobi, Kenya, selected at random for recruitment to the study from the subject pool maintained by the Busara Center for Behavioral Economics.

Study Design
The field experiment was conducted in Kawangware, an informal settlement located approximately 15 kilometers from the Nairobi city center. Participants were randomly assigned to three treatment groups, described below, located in three different community halls. Each community hall hosted four sessions per day at the same times each day: 9:30 AM, 11:30 AM, 1:30 PM, and 3:30 PM. 
After subjects were recruited by phone, they were asked to select one of four time slots during the day for their participation in the study. Once participants were confirmed for a given time slot, they were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups and notified of the location where they had to report every day. The assignment to one of three treatment groups were not known to the participants prior to arrival at the location. This design helped avoid any selection bias stemming the time of day that people chose for their participation in the study.

Treatment Groups
Subjects were randomized into three main treatment groups, namely: 
1. Work: People who worked in the treatment location for one hour each day in exchange for a daily payment of two unconditional PBK Nonic Supermarket vouchers.
2. Wait – Unconditional: People who waited in the treatment location for one hour each day in exchange for a daily payment of two unconditional PBK Nonic Supermarket vouchers.
3. Wait – Hybrid: People who waited in the treatment location for one hour each day in exchange for a daily payment of one unconditional PBK Nonic Supermarket voucher and one conditional PBK Nonic Supermarket voucher that could be used for “basic” food items only (Maize/wheat flour, rice, sugar, or cooking oil). 

The total face value of the vouchers provided each day to the subjects was therefore across treatments, and was an amount slightly higher than an average daily wage for most participants.

We conducted a 10-day randomized experiment with 432 individuals living below the poverty line in the Kawangware settlement of Nairobi, Kenya, testing two elements of social welfare design: workfare versus welfare and restricted versus unrestricted vouchers. Participants were randomly assigned to a “Work” condition, involving daily work for unrestricted vouchers, or one of two “Wait” conditions, involving daily waiting for vouchers that were either unrestricted or partially restricted to staple foods. We find that working improved psychological wellbeing relative to waiting, suggesting that the means of implementing welfare programs may have important effects on individuals beyond the impact of monetary benefit alone. Furthermore, although the restrictions were inframarginal, partially restricted vouchers crowded-in spending on staple foods, suggesting the existence of a “flypaper effect” in spending from restricted vouchers.

Intervention 1: Subsidized Daycare

The costs of formal daycare can be prohibitively costly to mothers with low earning potential, such as women living in the informal settlement areas of Nairobi.  Subsidizing daycare could lower this barrier to economic engagement and encourage mothers with young children to enter the labor force or work longer hours, thereby increasing their household’s total income. Such support may be particularly beneficial to disadvantaged women such as single mothers and recent immigrants who are expected to have the least social support in helping with their childcare. Women in this arm of our study will receive a full year of vouchers for free daycare services at selected local facilities. Participating daycares will also receive modest monthly cash transfers to compensate them for the additional monitoring and help them accommodate a possible increase in their number of enrolled pupils. 

Intervention 2: Subsidized Daycare at Improve Daycare Facilities

Given the low quality of some daycare centers in the informal settlements, some mothers may be reluctant to place their children in daycares regardless of the costs. To test whether the availability of affordable and high-quality daycares increase women’s engagement with the workforce, we provide quality improvements to half of the daycares we are subsidizing. These quality improvements include the training of all childcare providers in each selected center using an adapted program used by the Aga Khan Foundation, which is based on UNICEF/WHO’s Care for Child Development (C4CD) model, an Early Childhood Development (ECD) intervention. The C4CD intervention provides information and recommendations for cognitive stimulation and social support to young children, through sensitive and responsive caregiver-child interactions. The C4CD package guides health workers, caregivers, counsellors, and parents to build stronger relationships with their children, solve problems in caring for their children, and learn how to be sensitive and respond to the needs of the children. Childcare providers will also receive training on nutrition, child security, toy development, hygiene, sanitation, adequate sleep, and record keeping. The training will be covered in 5 full-days (after 2 days of a needs assessment pre-visit by the master trainers). Refresher training would also be offered half way through the intervention period. Two District Centres for Early Childhood Education (DICECE) officers will also be assigned to Korogocho area to check in and reinforce the learnings with caregivers through daycare visits, and act as the go between our project and the county government. Daycares in the quality arm will also receive material supplies in the form of mattresses, potties, padlocks (to increase security), and materials to build portable hand washing stations, toys, and teaching tools

child care responsibilities significantly impede their labor force participation. Yet, some have
questioned whether similar barriers exist in sub-Saharan Africa, where women primarily work in
the informal sector and may receive extensive kin support. To test whether child care obligations
limit African women from engaging in paid work, we conducted a randomized study which
provided subsidized early child care (ECC) to selected mothers living in a slum area of Nairobi,
Kenya. We found that not only are mothers eager to send their children to ECC centers, but also
that women who were given subsidized ECC were, on average, 8.5 percentage points (or over
17%) more likely than those who were not to be employed. This effect rose to over 20 percentage
points among women who actually used the ECC services. Furthermore, working mothers who
were given subsidized ECC were able to work fewer hours than those not given ECC without any
loss to their earnings. These findings provide strong evidence that subsidizing child care for
women in poor urban settings could be a powerful mechanism to improve female labor outcomes
and reduce gender inequalities in Africa.

In 2014, we designed and administered a mobile savings program to 311 randomly sampled residents from the Kibera and Viwandani settlements. This study aims to test the effect of using lotteries to increase demand for commitment savings by comparing the lottery-linked savings program with a standard interest-bearing program. This plan outlines our experimental design, identification strategy, and outcomes of interest.",,,,2014-05-01,2014-08-01,"We implemented our mobile-phone based savings program over Safaricom’s Sambaza airtime sharing service. Using Sambaza, Safaricom users can send airtime to each other free of charge. Subjects saved into our program by sending airtime to a designated project phone that held the airtime in an account for each user. We chose to run our savings program via airtime rather than M-Pesa to avoid the fees involved with conversion to and from M-Pesa.
Subjects received two SMS messages every morning after the first morning of the project period. The first message was an end-of-day message that reported how much the subject saved the previous day, how much the subject earned through interest or winnings, and their total balance. An hour later, subjects received a beginning-of-day message encouraging them to save that day. Subjects were allowed to send in savings at any time but any savings sent in after the end-of-day message would be counted towards the next day’s total. We used a custom-developed administrative system to manage the savings program. This system logged airtime sent to our project phone, maintained an internal ledger of balances, sent automated SMS confirmations after every transaction, and conducted the daily lottery game.
Subjects were enrolled in the savings program for a total of 60 days, split into consecutive 30-day periods. After the first 30 days, subjects were allowed to withdraw any amount of their savings up to the total balance. Outside of this opportunity, regular withdrawals were not allowed. If a subject wished to withdraw their balance, they were required to withdraw from the entire experiment.
At the end of our experiment, we returned subjects’ savings and accumulated interest or winnings via an M-Pesa transfer. This M-Pesa transfer included the extra withdrawal fees needed to cash out an amount equal to the subject’s full account balance. Therefore, subjects paid no explicit fees to participate in our program.
2.1 Treatment groups
Subjects were randomized into one of three treatment groups and had the chance to earn either daily interest (in the form of matching) or play a daily lottery depending on assign- ment.
2.1.1 Interest (control group)
Subjects in the control group participated in a standard, interest-bearing savings program. Subjects earned a 5% matching contribution on any amount that they saved in a particular day.
2.1.2 Lottery
After saving a non-zero amount, subjects earned a lottery ticket - transmitted via text message, which could win a cash prize in proportion to the amount they saved. A lottery ticket was a random sequence of four numbers between 1 and 9, inclusive. Each day, our administrative system randomly generated a winning sequence of four numbers. Prizes were awarded according to how well a subject’s lottery numbers matched the winning numbers. If the first or second numbers matched, a 10% match of savings was awarded. If both the first and second numbers matched, a 100% match of savings was awarded. Finally if all numbers matched, a prize of 200 times daily savings was awarded. The earnings on this

lottery ticket were equal in expectation to the 5% match earned in the control group. Our system processed the matching of lottery numbers and entered winnings into the internal ledger. Subjects could only earn one lottery ticket per day.","We estimate treatment effects on measured savings behavior. The main outcome variables we are interested in are:
1. Average savings over the entire study period.
2. Average savings over the first and second 30-day period.
3. Average number of active days and average number of transactions.
4. Average length of the streaks, i.e. the highest number of consecutive days with a positive balance for each person.
Aside from the overall savings behavior, we additionally estimate the effect of the program on:
1. Monthly self-reported savings balance

We recruited 311 subjects through Busara’s subject pool. Participants were first invited to the lab at Busara where they completed a computerized questionnaire and played various behavioral games. The following outlines the schedule of tasks during the lab portion of the study:
1. Risk preference elicitation 2. Time preference elicitation 3. Lottery task
4. Locus of control
5. Baseline questionnaire
Following the lab session, subjects were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups. Subjects were then taught about their assigned savings program. Each subject was given KSH 20 airtime credit and asked to practice saving using the Sambaza mechanism. Subjects were then sent home with business-card sized handouts which described their sav- ings program. We provided subjects simple instructions for saving and listed the number to our project phone. This was the number through which the savings program operated that also functioned as a help line for subjects.
Lab sessions took place over five weeks in May and June of 2014. Subjects were enrolled in the our savings program for two consecutive periods of 30 days starting from the day of a subject’s lab session. On a subject’s 30th day, a field officer called them and asked if they wished to withdraw any amount of their balance. Subjects who requested withdrawals

were sent M-Pesa tranfers equal to their request plus the M-Pesa withdrawal fee. These withdrawals were recorded in our system’s ledger.
Following this, subjects moved on to their second 30-day savings period. Subjects were called and notified a few days before the end of their second 30-day period that the program would be ending soon. After receiving the end-of-day message on their 60th day, subject were unenrolled from the program and were no longer allowed to save. Field officers called subjects to confirm final balances and sent M-Pesa transfers equal to total balance plus withdrawal fee shortly after. All subjects had completed the program by August 2014. In September 2014, we called subjects and conducted an endline survey.

Most households in rural sub-Saharan Africa and over 90% of households in rural Kenya are not connected to the grid. These households typically rely on kerosene lanterns with high operational costs and low-quality light. Prices for solar power have fallen dramatically, raising the possibility that solar energy could provide an alternative to kerosene, especially for lightning needs. This may allow households to save on energy expenditure, increase the time household members can spend on productive activities, and improve safety, as well as health and schooling outcomes. Solar lights have therefore attracted the attention of investors, entrepreneurs, donors, NGOs, and governments. Still, solar lights only provide minimal access to energy and despite the high hopes for this technology, there is little empirical evidence of its cost-effectiveness, its impact on household welfare, or its potential effect on the environment. Even less is known about what drives adoption of solar energy and solar lightning, in particular.

Consumption of high levels of aflatoxin can be fatal, and chronic exposure has been linked in numerous studies to liver cancer, suppressed immune response and child stunting. In Kenya, where maize is a staple in the diet, a significant proportion of maize and maize flour samples fail to meet regulatory standards, although these numbers can vary widely by year, season and region. One study by researchers with the CDC found that 65% of maize samples collected from 20 major millers did not meet the national standard (Gathura 2011) and a study using 2013 data found that 26% of maize flour samples were above this standard (Moser and Hoffmann 2015). Because aflatoxin is unobservable and regulatory standards are imperfectly enforced, even informed consumers cannot be confident of the safety of maize or maize flour available in the market.   Using a randomized controlled trial, we track the sales and prices of branded maize flour both before and after one of the brands becomes the first in Kenya to have its aflatoxin-testing procedures verified by a third party lab and to use a logo indicating this on its package.

We contribute to the literature in two important ways. First, consumer demand for food safety is not well understood.  Because modern regulatory systems keep unsafe food out of the market, consumers do not directly choose safety as an attribute in developed countries.  In markets where regulation is poorly in enforced or non-existent, consumers frequently do not have information on food safety.  Our project takes advantage of a unique opportunity to study an emerging food safety system in Kenya.  Commercial maize millers are beginning to respond to increasing consumer awareness of aflatoxin and pressure from the government by investing in aflatoxin testing.  A third-party verification program, which validates a mill's aflatoxin testing processes, recently became available to millers and provides millers a way to signal to consumers that their products are safe.

In terms of preventive health technologies in general, the evidence suggest that consumers' willingness to pay for such investments is low.  
Reasons likely include lack of awareness about the effectiveness or cost effectiveness of prevention measures, liquidity and credit constraints, present-biased time preferences, and attention constraints (Dupas, 2011; Spears, 2009; Kremer and Glennerster, 2011). However unlike other health investments that require discrete shifts in one’s use of time, attention or other scarce resources, households already purchase food; purchasing the brand that has been tested requires only a minor change in behavior. Further, the cost of purchasing safe food is a marginal increase to an unavoidable cash outlay; consumers are known to be less price sensitive to additional costs compared to stand-alone costs. Finally, food safety may be  perceived to be correlated with other food attributes, such as taste or consistent quality.  

Second, we contribute to the understanding of sustained behavior change.  Although a pilot study found a high willingness-to-pay for a one-time purchase of aflatoxin-tested maize, it may be that the introduction of tested maize constituted a temporary shock to the salience of aflatoxin as a health risk, and that demand for tested maize will fall as this salience fades. Consumers may also falsely believe that tested maize will be correlated with attributes such as improved taste, and revert to untested maize when this is found not to the case. While several studies test the impact of information on health behavior at a single point in time (Madajewicz et al, 2007; Jalan and Somanathan, 2008; Luoto 2009), we are not aware of work that characterizes the dynamic impact of information. Learning and limited attention models give different predictions about the dynamic impact of information on health behavior. A learning model predicts that information leads to permanent behavior change, whereas a limited attention model, in which information increases the salience of a particular health risk temporarily, predicts that the effect of information diminishes over time (DellaVigna, 2009). 
",,,,2015-06-08,2015-11-30,"The project took advantage of a program launched in Kenya by Texas A&M AgriLife Research in 2014 to build the aflatoxin testing capacity of maize industry and regulatory bodies.  The program, Aflatoxin Proficiency Testing and Control for Africa (APTECA), is patterned after a successful aflatoxin co-regulation program in Texas.   In order to use the APTECA logo on packaging or marketing materials, millers are required to: pass an aflatoxin analysis proficiency test, conduct weekly analysis of laboratory control samples to ensure testing accuracy, and develop and adhere to a rigorous aflatoxin food safety plan. Weekly audits of test records and related processes help ensure adherence to protocols.   Companies repeatedly testing above the regulatory limit for aflatoxin must undertake corrective action and face a temporary suspension of APTECA logo use. 

The project partnered with the first commercial maize miller in Kenya to join the APTECA program and incorporate the “Alfatoxin tested verified by APTECA” label in its packaging and marketing materials.   Because this is a potentially high-risk investment for a miller, costs of compliance with APTECA requirements beyond the firms’ current procedures during the study period were covered through research funds, and APTECA membership was provided free of charge through Texas AgriLife Research.  

Six months prior to the launch of the labeled product, the miller provided lists of shops and distributors carrying their brand in 6 counties. Shops meeting the following criteria were considered for the study:  shops could not be within easy walking distance of another shop in study, shops sold at least 48 kg of the study brand per week and shops had to be willing and able to track sales and prices of all maize flour in their shops. Fifteen shops in each county were initially recruited into the study.  

After eligibility screening, shop owners were invited to participate in the study. They were told that if they chose to participate, they would be asked to track maize flour sales daily and provide this information to the study staff weekly; in compensation they would receive a monthly payment of 2000 Kenyan shillings (approximately $22 US at the time). A shop survey was then administered to the shop owner, which covered the volume of sales of the participating miller’s products as well as maize flour more generally, and basic characteristics of the shop.

Sales and prices of all maize flour brands were recorded by participating shop owners in a ledger provided to them. Field officers collected sales tracking ledgers weekly, and reviewed entries with the owners before entering the data electronically.  In this way, shop owners were trained and retrained on how to correctly complete the sales sheets well in advance of the intervention.  The price of whole grain maize at a vendor near each participating shop was also recorded by study staff during data collection visits  Over the first two months of sales tracking, several shops were dropped from the sample based on failure to consistently complete sales records. Of the remaining 78 shops, five shops with much higher total maize flour sales than the rest were dropped from the sample.

In June 2015 the miller’s existing brand began appearing in shops with the logo.  Shops were assigned to the following treatment groups based on random assignment after stratifying by county and average weekly sales of the miller’s product:
1. Control (24 shops)
2. Initial marketing only (12 shops)
3. Multiple marketing rounds, no discount (12 shops)
4. Initial discount + marketing (12 shops)
5. Multiple discount rounds + marketing (13 shops)

Once the mill began using the packages with the logo, all shops stocked the new packages, but in the control shops nothing was done to draw attention to the product change.  While it is not likely that consumers will notice the addition of the small logo on the packet or understand its significance, follow-up interviews will determine what consumers knew or noticed about the aflatoxin logo.

Marketing treatments consisted of week-long leafletting campaigns at the shop and nearby open-air market where whole-grain maize is sold in addition to hanging posters at the shop for the duration of the study.  The initial marketing groups received one week of marketing, while in multiple marketing treatments, the leafletting was repeated three times in four weeks intervals.  The discount treatment reduced the price during the first week of marketing to induce consumers of cheaper brands or whole grain maize to switch.  In the multiple discount treatment the discount was repeated during the second marketing campaign. The discount was a flat discount of 5 Kenyan shillings per kg, roughly a 10 percent discount. Field officers were trained to explain the leaflet content in local languages. Sales of all brands were tracked for 6 months.  A baseline study of over 2000 consumers in these markets conducted in March 2015 allows us to characterize maize consumption and purchase behavior as well as socio-demographic characteristics of potential buyers and follow up with these consumers after the randomized controlled trial. An endline survey was conducted in November 2015.

The violence-prevention intervention is a community-level intervention that uses the community dialogues and contracts strategy based on the UNDP/Concern Worldwide model (1). The education intervention is a conditional cash transfer (CCT) based on 80% attendance over the course of a term. The health intervention will follow the Council’s Safe Spaces model (2) in which girls meet in groups once a week under the guidance of a female mentor from the community. The wealth-creation intervention is composed of financial education, which is delivered during Safe Spaces meetings, as well as savings through individual bank accounts (Nairobi) or home banks (Wajir) and a small savings incentives. The following packages of interventions will be tested:
        1) Violence Prevention

","The primary outcome measures for the study, to be assessed after 2 years and then again after 4 years, are increased age at first birth, increased age at first sex and increased age at first marriage. 

Secondary outcomes include the following:

1. Violence Prevention - Decreased experience of gender-based violence and improved gender norms related to violence

2. Education - Increased mean grade of schooling and increased rate  of primary school completion

3. Health - Increased knowledge on sexual and reproductive health and improved decision-making skills

4. Wealth Creation - Increased knowledge on financial education, increased saving and increased participation in income generating activities
",,,,"The overall, long-term goal of the interventions is to reduce adolescent fertility by improving the well-being of girls in program sites. AGI-K will test multi-sectoral packages of interventions to answer the following research question: 

Which combination(s) of interventions produce(s) the greatest change in the well-being of adolescent girls? 

Due to the difference in context, cultures, and cost-structures, this study consists of two sub-studies with independent datasets: the Wajir sub-study and the Urban Nairobi Slums sub-study. The research design for the study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The unit of randomization is different for the two sites: cluster randomization in Wajir and individual-level randomization in Nairobi. In Wajir, which is less densely populated, a cluster-level design allows for randomization to different combinations of interventions at the community level, while reaching a similar number of girls. In addition, a nonexperimental external control site was included in the design for the Nairobi sub-study to enable comparison of intervention arms with a similar area that did not receive any of the four program interventions. 

The project will be evaluated using data from behavioral surveys conducted at baseline, midterm (after 2 years), and endline (after 4 years); a cost-effectiveness and value-for-money costing study; a qualitative study to provide insights into the results shown in the quantitative data regarding the impact of the interventions; and program-monitoring data to track program attendance and participation. 
",,"Nairobi - randomization was done using the Excel random number generator. A unique ID was assigned to each girl and the list was randomly ordered, then then divided into 4 groups based on this order. Community stakeholders randomly selected a card with the study arm for each group.

Using health markets as the unit of intervention (clusters of health facilities where no facility is more than 4 KM from the center of the market), we experimentally allocate all private and public health facilities in three Kenyan counties to one of three arms: (1) high-intensity inspections with enforcement of warnings and sanctions for non-compliant facilities; (2) high-intensity inspections with enforcement of warnings and sanctions for non-compliant facilities and public disclosure of inspection results, and (3) “business-as-usual” low-probability inspections (the control group). The results from this study will contribute to understanding the extent to which governance and accountability mechanisms can help improve service delivery in low-income countries, particularly in this case related to improving patient safety and quality of care in the public and private sectors, and if so, how these systems may operate when they are implemented “at scale.” Another important contribution of this project is the development of a set of tools and instruments that can be broadly deployed both in surveys of quality and in the design of inspection systems across diverse low-income settings.",,,,2016-11-14,2017-12-15,"1272 health facilities in three Kenyan counties–Kakamega, Kilifi and Meru–are experimentally allocated to three arms: (1) high-intensity inspections with enforcement of warnings and sanctions for non-compliant facilities; (2) high-intensity inspections with enforcement of warnings and sanctions for non-compliant facilities and public disclosure of inspection results; and (3) “business-as-usual” low-probability inspections (the control group). 

The new regulatory framework used for this experiment was developed previous to the implementation of these pilots including: (A) a refined Joint Health Inspections Checklist (henceforth Checklist) that is easy to deploy and is focused on the fundamentals of patient safety; (B) a scoring system that allows facilities to be categorized according to the level of risk presented to patients; (C) scores that trigger warnings and sanctions to be enforced according to a facility’s level of risk. 

Treatment 1 - High-intensity inspections: Every facility in this treatment group will be inspected using a checklist of safety standards that was developed in consensus and refined over 3 years. The health facilities will receive a copy of the Checklist and will be warned or sanctioned according to their risk performance.

Treatment 2 - High-intensity inspections and public disclosure of patient safety performance: Every facility in this treatment group will be inspected as in treatment 1. Following the inspection, facilities will be assigned a letter-grade to be prominently posted outside the health facility. The health facilities will receive a copy of the Checklist results with details on their assessment and grade. A campaign introducing patients to the grading system will be included as part of the accountability system.

Control - “Business-as-usual” health inspections: Health facilities in this group will operate under the current regime for health inspections, which results in inspections less than 4% of the time. These facilities did not receive routine inspections during the implementation period.","We examine the impact of the intervention on a triad of outcome groups that are important in settings with public and private providers: Quality of care and Patient Safety, Quantity and Prices. 

Quality and Patient Safety will be measured through three main indicators that gauge diverse dimensions of quality and patient safety at different points in the continuum of the health care chain: (1) Adherence to a Checklist developed by the regulators and that includes indicators of quality and patient safety related to protocols, infrastructure, and equipment at the health facility level; (2) Adherence to patient safety practices related to infection prevention and control; (3) Adherence to case-specific checklists of essential and recommended care for four medical cases (subject to budget availability). Quantity (demand) of care services will be measured through patient flow records from health facilities and administrative data, and prices will be measured through patient exit surveys. ","Below is a list of the main outcomes of interest for this analysis, as well as the source and the method of data collection used in each case.  

• Adherence to a Checklist of quality of care and patient safety standards. This is a Checklist for Singular/Joint Inspections for Public and Private Medical Institutions, which has been developed by a technical working group (TWG) including the regulatory bodies under the Ministry of Health, the private sector, and other stakeholders. This Checklist includes indicators of infrastructure, equipment, staff characteristics, and protocols to measure quality and patient safety across all units of a health facility, and hence it allows measuring how facilities stand with respect to the standards set by the regulation. The results are mapped into a score and the measure of adherence we will use is the score as a percentage of the maximum score possible for each facility. We developed an electronic version of this Checklist. Data will be collected through surveys to the facility in-charge and staff, as well as through observation and verification during the surveys following closely the protocols that inspectors follow when they conduct inspections. 

• Adherence to patient safety practices related to infection prevention, and control (IPC) in primary care,  which are measured by direct observation of select practices in 3 outpatient sites. These outcomes will measure adherence to patient safety practices for five groups: (i) hand hygiene, (ii) injection and blood draw practices, (iii) use of gloves, (iv) disinfection of reusable equipment, and (v) waste segregation. This selection was based on their high-value (i.e. strong link to health-care infections), high frequency of opportunities (i.e., points in time during the care chain when a patient safety practice should be performed to avoid likely adverse events), and feasibility to develop valid, reliable, and generalizable indicators in the planned time and conditions. Adherence indicators are based on indications and actions and adapted to the specific violation.

• Adherence to case-specific checklists of essential and recommended care for 4 medical cases (subject to budget availability). This dimension of quality of care and patient safety is measured through Standardized Patients, which allows us to gauge the extent of correct treatment (both under and over-treatment) in these facilities. The method of Standardized Patients (SPs) was used in the first large-scale population study in India in 2008-2009 (See, e.g., Das et al., 2012). SPs are people from the local community who are extensively trained to present the same case to multiple providers. To assess the quality of care, SPs are trained to recall all history questions, examinations, and diagnoses. They are debriefed with a structured questionnaire within one hour of the interaction. The quality of medical advice is assessed by the time spent with patients, by providers’ adherence to case-specific checklists of essential and recommended care, the likelihood of correct diagnosis, and the appropriateness of treatment. SPs will undergo an exit survey where the data on their interaction with the doctor is recorded.

• Price of services at health facilities. The data on prices will come from a short survey that will be collected from patients from various demographic characteristics exiting the health facilities, as well as from SPs. In large health facilities, sampling of patients will be done randomly using a skip routine. 

• Quantity (demand) of health care services: The data on demand corresponds to the number of patients in the last complete month at the time of the survey, collected at the health facility level through a survey from the forms reported to the MOH, or from the facility's alternative record system. ",,,"We use an stratified cluster randomized experimental design to estimate the causal impact of the interventions at the facility level, where the clusters are markets of health facilities (where facilities are within 4 km from the market center) and stratification happens at the market size and county level. We experimentally allocate around 273 markets and all facilities (around 1,272) in each market in the three evaluation counties to one of the three accountability systems (treatment 1, 2 and control).  We will also present results at the market level. For this analysis, this is an stratified random experimental design where the unit of analysis is the same as the unit of randomization.","For the analysis at the facility level, this evaluation uses a cluster randomized experimental design to estimate the causal impact of the interventions, where the clusters are markets of health facilities, and the cluster size is the market size, or number of health facilities per cluster. All local markets of health facilities in the three counties–Kakamega, Kilifi, and Meru–will be randomized into treatment and control groups, taking into consideration the size of the market. At the market level, the design is an stratified random design, with stratification at the market size.

The three counties were chosen after an extensive consultation with representatives of the Kenyan county health executives, based on prior analysis of health markets in all Kenyan counties. Specifically, we constructed health markets in each county and highlighted the counties that contained markets with diverse sizes. In some counties like Turkana, there were few markets with more than one health facility (typically in the arid Northern counties) and evaluations from these counties would not be predictive of performance in denser health markets. In other counties, such as Mombasa, most health facilities are in markets with a large number of other health facilities. In such counties, the predictive power of the evaluation for smaller markets is poor. Ten counties satisfied our technical criteria of health markets with diverse sizes. The analysis and counties were discussed with the county health executives, who decided the ultimate study areas. 

The choice of a cluster-randomized experimental design stems from the nature of the intervention and the relevance of capturing the effect of the intervention at the market level. Particularly, the treatment applied to one health facility is thought to have potential spillovers on geographically proximate health facilities through consumer demand. Therefore, the cluster-randomized design was selected because of the potential spillover at the market-level, and the policy-relevance of impacts at this level in terms of quality of care and patient safety, quantity and prices. 

The markets are defined at this stage by geographic delimitations. Based on preliminary data from the baseline from around 8,500 patients surveyed we find that around 75% of the respondents live 4 km or closer from the health facility they visited. Using this distance, we apply a clustering algorithm called the K-means algorithm that identifies markets of health facilities by the nearest center, conditional on the K-distance to the center. Our algorithm stops creating new clusters when all facilities are within the predefined distance (4 km) from their respective market center. Based on this exercise, we estimate there are 273 such markets in the three counties selected, with diverse market size ranging from singletons to markets with 2, 3, 4, 5 or more health facilities. 

In total, we have 16 strata. For each county, we have 5 strata by market size for markets with 1, 2, 3, 4-10, and 11+ health facilities. In addition, we worry that extreme-value markets may not be balanced for analysis at the health facility level therefore a stratification of extreme values was added for Meru. Therefore, we have an additional stratum for market size 34 or more health facilities (3 markets) in Meru for a total of 16 strata. This is important because, for our analysis at the health facility level, imbalances in the market size (e.g., that all big markets end up only in one treatment arm or in the control group) will affect that level of analysis. We have 87 markets in the control group (411 facilities), 90 markets in the treatment group 1 (388 facilities), and 96 markets in the treatment group 2 with scorecards (473 facilities).",Randomization done in office by a computer.,Market of health facilities,273 markets of health facilities,"273 markets of health facilities, 1,272 health facilities","Treatment 1: 90 markets, 388 health facilities

The schools participating in the program consisted of nearly all rural primary schools in Budalangi and Funyula divisions in southern Busia district, and contained more than 30,000 pupils at the start of the study. Baseline parasitological surveys conducted by the Kenyan Ministry of Health indicated that these divisions had high rates of helminth infection at over 90%. Using modified WHO infection thresholds (Brooker et al., 2000b), roughly one-third of children in the sample had “moderate to heavy” infections with at least one helminth at the time of the baseline survey, a rate not atypical by regional standards (Brooker et al., 2000a). The 1998 Kenya DHS indicated that 85% of children in western Kenya, in the relevant age range of 8-18 years, were enrolled in school – suggesting that the sample was broadly representative of western Kenyan children as a whole at the time. 

The 75 program schools were randomly divided into three groups (Groups 1, 2, and 3) of 25 schools each: the schools were stratified by geographical area (division, then zone), the zones were listed alphabetically (within each division), and then within each zone the schools were listed in increasing order of student enrolment, and every third school was assigned to a given project group. Due to the NGO’s administrative and financial constraints, the schools were phased into the program over the course of 1998-2001, and the order of phase-in was randomly determined, creating experimental treatment groups. Group 1 schools began receiving free deworming in 1998, Group 2 schools in 1999, while Group 3 schools began receiving the drugs in 2001.

This document provides an overview of the data collected in an effort to monitor and evaluate the Primary School Deworming Project (PSDP), a primary school health intervention in rural Kenya. From 1998 until 2002, medical treatment for intestinal helminths (worms) was provided by a local non-governmental organization, Internationaal Christelijk Steunfonds Africa (ICS), to 75 rural Kenyan primary schools in the western district of Busia. Medical treatment was randomly “phased in” to the 75 schools between 1998 and 2001. Schools phased into the assistance project in earlier years served as “treatment schools”, and those phased in later as “comparison schools” in the evaluation.

The seventy-five schools participating in the program consisted of nearly all rural primary schools in the Budalangi and Funyula divisions of southern Busia district, and contained nearly 35,000 pupils at the start of the study. Baseline parasitological surveys conducted by the Kenyan Ministry of Health indicate that these two divisions had high rates of helminth infection, at over 90% (levels not atypical by sub-Saharan African standards, see Brooker et al. 2000). The data described here is employed in Miguel and Kremer (2004).

Abstract: ESTIMATING DEWORMING SCHOOL PARTICIPATION IMPACTS IN KENYA: A COMMENT ON AIKEN ET AL. (2014B)

Aiken et al. (2014b) draw the conclusion that the evidence for a relationship between deworming and school attendance is “weak” based on two fundamental errors in their data analysis. First, the authors redefine treatment to include pre-treatment control periods. Second, while the original research design was based on a stepped-wedge analysis that was adequately powered, the re-analysis
authors undertake a clearly under-powered alternative analysis which ignores the time series element of the data, and then splits the cross-sectional analysis into two separate components, each of which has inadequate power. Examining the fully powered analysis, they report: “In a fully-adjusted logistic regression model making maximum use of the data available, there appeared to be strong evidence of an improvement in school attendance”. If either error is corrected, deworming significantly increases school attendance under the full range of statistical analyses considered by Aiken et al. Their analysis also underestimates the impact of deworming on school attendance by neglecting violations of the SUTVA assumption generated by transmission of worm infection to nearby schools (Miguel and Kremer 2004). We also respond to concerns raised by Aiken et al. regarding data collection processes and blinding.

Abstract: ESTIMATING DEWORMING SCHOOL PARTICIPATION IMPACTS AND EXTERNALITIES IN KENYA: A COMMENT ON AIKEN ET AL. (2014)

Aiken et al. (2014) usefully correct some errors in Miguel and Kremer (2004). Miguel and Kremer (2004) made two key claims: 1) deworming creates positive epidemiological externalities, thus causing estimates of the impact of deworming based on individual randomization to be biased downwards; and 2) deworming increases school participation. The results in Aiken et al. (2014) are consistent with these findings. In addition to direct impacts of deworming treatment on worm infections, Aiken et al. (2014) find externality effects within schools on untreated pupils, as well as externality effects across schools up to 3 km away. Similarly, with regard to school participation, both Miguel and Kremer (2004) and Aiken et al. (2014) find direct effects of deworming and externality effects within schools on untreated pupils. As Aiken et al. (2014) point out, most of the errors they identify (rounding errors or updates to the data set) lead to only small changes in estimated coefficients. The key change is that Miguel and Kremer (2004) measured externalities among schools located within 3-6 km that were among the 12 closest schools, rather than among all schools within 3-6 km, as reported; Aiken et al. (2014) report results including the full set of schools within 3-6 km. With the updated data, there is no evidence that worm infection externalities extend beyond the 12 closest schools to the full set of schools within 6 km, perhaps unsurprisingly given the local nature of disease transmission. We disagree with Aiken et al.’s (2014) conclusion that “there was no evidence of a between-school indirect effect” or an overall effect of deworming on school participation. We show that this conclusion is based on an approach that adds substantial noise to the estimation, by heavily weighting a non-significant 3-6 km externality estimate. This note addresses these and other points, and comments on the current state of deworming evidence.

Abstract: WORMS: IDENTIFYING IMPACTS ON EDUCATION AND HEALTH IN THE PRESENCE OF TREATMENT EXTERNALITIES

Intestinal helminths—including hookworm, roundworm, whipworm, and schistosomiasis—infect more than one-quarter of the world’s population. Studies in which medical treatment is randomized at the individual level potentially doubly underestimate the benefits of treatment, missing externality benefits to the comparison group from reduced disease transmission, and therefore also underestimating benefits for the treatment group. We evaluate a Kenyan project in which school-based mass treatment with deworming drugs was randomly phased into schools, rather than to individuals, allowing estimation of overall program effects. The program reduced school absenteeism in treatment schools by one-quarter, and was far cheaper than alternative ways of boosting school participation. Deworming substantially improved health and school participation among untreated children in both treatment schools and neighboring schools, and these externalities are large enough to justify fully subsidizing treatment. Yet we do not find evidence that deworming improved academic test scores.

",,,1998-03-01,2001-12-31,"In 1998, a local non-governmental organization (NGO) launched a program known as the Primary School Deworming Program (PSDP) to provide deworming medication to individuals enrolled in 75 primary schools in Busia District, a densely-settled farming region of rural western Kenya adjacent to Lake Victoria. The schools participating in the program consisted of nearly all rural primary schools in Budalangi and Funyula divisions in southern Busia district, and contained more than 30,000 pupils at the start of the study. Baseline parasitological surveys conducted by the Kenyan Ministry of Health indicated that these divisions had high rates of helminth infection at over 90%. Using modified WHO infection thresholds (Brooker et al., 2000b), roughly one-third of children in the sample had “moderate to heavy” infections with at least one helminth at the time of the baseline survey, a rate not atypical by regional standards (Brooker et al., 2000a). The 1998 Kenya DHS indicated that 85% of children in western Kenya, in the relevant age range of 8-18 years, were enrolled in school – suggesting that the sample was broadly representative of western Kenyan children as a whole at the time. 

The 75 program schools were randomly divided into three groups (Groups 1, 2, and 3) of 25 schools each: the schools were stratified by geographical area (division, then zone), the zones were listed alphabetically (within each division), and then within each zone the schools were listed in increasing order of student enrolment, and every third school was assigned to a given project group. Due to the NGO’s administrative and financial constraints, the schools were phased into the program over the course of 1998-2001, and the order of phase-in was randomly determined, creating experimental treatment groups. Group 1 schools began receiving free deworming in 1998, Group 2 schools in 1999, while Group 3 schools began receiving the drugs in 2001. The project design implies that in 1998, Group 1 schools were treatment schools while Group 2 and 3 schools were the control, and in 1999 and 2000, Group 1 and 2 schools were the treatment schools and Group 3 schools the control, and so on. In 2002 all schools received free treatment. Children in Group 1 and 2 schools thus received two to three more years of deworming than Group 3 children. Deworming drugs were offered twice per year in treatment schools.

This study uses the Primary School Deworming Project (PSDP) to test several interventions including the following: social links, cost-sharing, health education, and verbal commitment. 

Social links: Parent questionnaire respondents were asked for information on their closest social links: the five friends they speak with most frequently, the five relatives they speak with most frequently, additional social contacts whose children attend local primary schools, and individuals with whom they speak specifically about child health issues. These individuals are collectively referred to as the respondent’s direct “social links.” The survey also collected information on the deworming treatment status of social links’ children and the effects of treatment on their health, how frequently the respondent speaks with each social link, which primary schools links’ children attend, the global positioning system (GPS) location of the respondent’s home, and respondent’s knowledge of worm infections and attitudes toward deworming. 

Cost-sharing: Between 1998 and 1999 PSDP delivered free deworming pills to 50 sample schools. In 2001, they were randomized again to assign half the schools to a cost-sharing intervention while the other half continued to receive free treatment. Two thirds of the schools participating in cost-sharing received albendazole at a cost of USD $0.40 per family, and one third received both albendazole and praziquantel (depending on the local prevalence of schistosomiasis) at a cost of USD $1.30 per family.

Health education: In addition to medication, all treatment schools received regular public health lectures, wall charts on worm prevention, and a full-day training session for two teachers from each school. The lectures and teacher training provided information on worm prevention behaviors—including washing hands before meals, wearing shoes, and not swimming in the lake. 

Verbal commitment: A random subsample of pupils were asked whether they were planning to come to school on the next treatment day and whether the PSDP workers should bring pills for them on that day: 98 percent of children answered “yes” to both questions. All pupils interviewed—including both those offered the opportunity for verbal commitment and those not offered this opportunity—were provided the same information on the effects of deworming and the upcoming date of medical treatment.","1.

",,,2009-05-01,2009-12-31,"Artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) are now the only effective drugs in many malaria-endemic regions. In Kenya they are available in government clinics and retail drug stores. Public health clinics are often out of stock while the drug is unaffordable for the poor at full retail price. Subsidizing the drugs at the retail level can make the drug affordable but at the risk of over-treatment. The study attempts two interventions to test the trade-off between overtreatment and underteatment with ACTs.

Sample households are assigned to one of three treatment arms. In the first treatment arm, households received vouchers to purchase ACTs at full price from their nearest drug store. In the second treatment arm, the ACTs are subsidized at 92%, 88% or 80%. In the third treatment arm, households received subsidized rapid diagnostic malaria tests (RDT) in addition to the ACT subsidies. 

In order to find out what fraction of people buying ACTs were truly malaria positive—a proxy for how well an ACT subsidy would be targeted—the researchers also selected a random subset of the households in all treatment groups to receive the offer of a “surprise” free RDT after they completed their transaction at the drug shop.
","The ultimate aim in this trial is to study how retail sector ACT subsidies impact both under-treatment (UT , the share of true malaria illnesses that are not treated with ACTs) and over-treatment ( OT , the share of non-malaria illnesses that are treated with ACTs). Since collecting the data to directly measure these outcomes was not logistically feasible, UT and OT are estimated indirectly by measuring:

1)	Access: the share of all illness episodes treated with an ACT
2)	Targeting: the share of ACT takers who are actually malaria positive
","1) Access:  A malaria positivity index was created for all illness episodes, based on a symptoms database (N = 533) collected from the study population. During unannounced home visits, trained surveyors asked if anyone was feeling ill, and if yes, they collected information about symptoms (using the same survey instrument used in the endline survey and then tested the patient for malaria with an RDT. This data is then used to impute a malaria probability to the universe of illness episodes enumerated at endline and all illnesses observed at drug shops.

2) Targeting: A subsample of those redeeming the ACT voucher are administered a “surprise RCT” unless they are part of the ACT+RDT treatment arm and had already redeemed their RDT voucher prior to getting their ACT.
",,,"Four rural drug stores, in a rural market setting, were selected. All households within a 4 km radius catchment area were sampled at baseline. At the end of the survey, the household was informed of its treatment status (full price ACT, ACT subsidy or ACT+RDT subsidy) and a voucher given accordingly. Each household was given two vouchers for ACT and two for RDT (if applicable) that could be redeemed at the study drug store. The drug dispensed was specific to the age of the patient. All ACTs and RDTs were provided by trained study officers posted at the drug shop for the duration of the study.

Additionally, to test what proportion of patients buying ACT was actually positive for malaria, a random subsample was given the option of a free RDT test after they had redeemed their ACT voucher. If the patient had not come to the drug store, the officer went to the patient’s home to administer the test. During the endline survey, administered about four months after the vouchers were distributed, households were informed the study was ending and all vouchers were collected back.

We explore this argument through a field experiment in Kenya, in which we randomized the price at which prenatal clinics could sell long-lasting antimalarial insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) to pregnant women. We find no evidence that cost-sharing reduces wastage on those who will not use the product: women who received free ITNs are not less likely to use them than those who paid subsidized positive prices. We also find no evidence that costs haring induces selection of women who need the net more: those who pay higher prices appear no sicker than the average prenatal client in the area in terms of measured anemia (an important indicator of malaria). Cost-sharing does, however, considerably dampen demand. We find that uptake drops by sixty percentage points when the price of ITNs increases from zero to $0.60 (i.e., from 100% to 90% subsidy), a price still $0.15 below the price at which ITNs are currently sold to pregnant women in Kenya. We combine our estimates in a cost-effectiveness analysis of the impact of ITN prices on child mortality that incorporates both private and social returns to ITN usage. Overall, our results suggest that free distribution of ITNs could save many more lives than cost-sharing programs have achieved so far, and, given the large positive externality associated with widespread usage of ITNs, would likely do so at a lesser cost per life saved.","Description: J-PAL Evaluation Summary

Surveyors checked to see whether the net had been taken out of the packaging, whether it was hanging, and the condition of the net. During study rollout, clinic staff, enumerators or study participants were not informed that such visits would be conducted in order to ensure that usage was not unusually high due to Hawthorne effects.

It is often argued that cost-sharing—charging a subsidized, positive price—for a health product is necessary to avoid wasting resources on those who will not use or do not need the product. We explore this argument through a field experiment in Kenya, in which we randomized the price at which prenatal clinics could sell long-lasting antimalarial insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) to pregnant women. We find no evidence that cost-sharing reduces wastage on those who will not use the product: women who received free ITNs are not less likely to use them than those who paid subsidized positive prices. We also find no evidence that costs haring induces selection of women who need the net more: those who pay higher prices appear no sicker than the average prenatal client in the area in terms of measured anemia (an important indicator of malaria). Cost-sharing does, however, considerably dampen demand. We find that uptake drops by sixty percentage points when the price of ITNs increases from zero to $0.60 (i.e., from 100% to 90% subsidy), a price still $0.15 below the price at which ITNs are currently sold to pregnant women in Kenya. We combine our estimates in a cost-effectiveness analysis of the impact of ITN prices on child mortality that incorporates both private and social returns to ITN usage. Overall, our results suggest that free distribution of ITNs could save many more lives than cost-sharing programs have achieved so far, and, given the large positive externality associated with widespread usage of ITNs, would likely do so at a lesser cost per life saved.

Abstract: EDUCATION AS LIBERATION?

Less developed regions have experienced massive increases in both education and democracy over the past half century, and it is widely claimed that many recent democratic transitions have been propelled by increasingly educated youth populations. Scholars have also speculated about education’s social and political impacts, variously arguing that education promotes “modern” pro-democratic and secular attitudes and weakens ethnic attachments; that it instills acceptance of existing authority; and that it empowers the disadvantaged. These views have informed international efforts to promote education in poor countries, often focusing on girls. We assess the social and political impacts of a randomized girls’ merit scholarship incentive program in Kenya that raised test scores and secondary school enrollment. Counter to modernization theory, increased human capital did not produce more pro-democratic or secular attitudes and, if anything, it strengthened ethnic identification. Consistent with the empowerment view, young women in program schools had fewer arranged marriages and were less likely to accept domestic violence as legitimate. Moreover, the program increased objective political knowledge, and reduced both acceptance of political authorities and satisfaction with politics. However, in our Kenyan context, this rejection of the status quo did not translate into greater perceived political efficacy, community participation or voting intentions. Instead, the program increased the perceived legitimacy of political violence. We argue that selection bias may account for the view that education instills greater acceptance of authority.

While industrial clusters of very small firms provide some economic benefits, such as reducing input costs, firms operating in these clusters often operate inefficiently, use limited capital, do not consolidate or differentiate, and fail to grow significantly. Though various factors constrain the growth of small firms, several prominent impediments to growth are a lack of access to physical and human capital and access to markets.

A body of research indicates that these factors matter, and that alleviating constraints increases the productivity and profitability of small businesses. For example, in randomized controlled trials in Sri Lanka and Mexico, capital grants to small enterprises were very effective in boosting profits. The marginal return to capital in these studies ranged from 60% to 250%, with larger effects on more capital-constrained businesses. (McKenzie and Woodruff, 2008 ; de Mel et al., 2008). Even 5 years post-grant, treated Sri Lankan businesses had significantly higher profits relative to control groups and were more likely to have survived (de Mel et all., 2012).

Lack of necessary skills may also limit small business growth. Impact evaluations testing the effects of teaching business skills to entrepreneurs have generally shown moderate changes in adoption of business practices but uncertain effects on business outcomes (Karlan and Valdivia, 2010 ; Drexler et. al., 2011 ; McKenzie and Woodruff, 2012). The effects of non-business skills training have been more positive, with experiments showing large increases in participant wages after a variety of practical job skills trainings (Attanasio et al., 2011; Card et al., 2011)
Access to markets is another limiting factor for small businesses. Kenyan manufacturers we interviewed repeatedly referenced finding new customers as a main concern, expressed high levels of interest in marketing programs, and reported producing well below capacity. Evidence from other countries shows that enhanced market access drives improved quality and better performance for small businesses.

Though results from this research offer the promise of increased innovation, scale and success for small businesses, the translation of research into feasible and practical models for creating benefits has lagged behind. In particular, it is necessary to understand the appropriate combinations of support to small-scale entrepreneurs to maximize benefits and how to package and deliver that support in a financially sustainable manner that permits scale – this requires further experimentation.

To augment prior research we will evaluate the services offered by WorkShop – a social enterprise launching in Nairobi that is currently being incubated within the Busara Center for Behavioral Economics. WorkShop offers several services related to the constraints faced by small producers:

•	Capital: WorkShop offers producers access to quality, industrial grade tools
•	Human capital: WorkShop offers training (on design, production best practices and business management) 
•	Marketing: in addition to marketing training, WorkShop brands and markets products produced by independent producers
","Approximately 3 months after craftsmen receive WorkShop services, Busara will conduct a follow up survey of all craftsmen. In addition to surveying craftsmen themselves, Busara will ask craftsmen to provide the contact information of recent customer and will survey those customers. Outcomes measured are described below. Outcomes with a * are primary outcomes, other outcomes are secondary outcomes.

•	Production: 
o	Volumes by type of product (#)
o	Productivity (index: relative productivity per type of furniture, defined as [pieces / hour] / [average sample pieces / hour], weighted by share of specific furniture type)*

o	Overall satisfaction with piece purchased (1 – 5 scale)*
",,,,"Initially, the Busara Center for Behavioral Economics will conduct a census of craftsmen in WorkShop’s target areas. This census will collect the contact information of craftsmen as well as basic demographic information and baseline data (e.g., baseline profits).

From the census data ~1,500 individuals will be identified as eligible to benefit from WorkShop’s services. As our goal is to improve the outcomes of small-scale craftsmen, we will only consider craftsmen associated with workshops having less than 5 individuals working there. 

Due to capacity constraints, WorkShop is only able to provide services to a limited number of craftsmen. This creates the opportunity to randomize for the purposes of evaluation. Approximately 750 individuals will be randomly offered to participate in WorkShop’s core training program (design, production best practices and business skills). Randomization will be at the individual level and stratified by the size of the workshop the individual is associated with.

Within the treatment group of ~750 craftsmen, we will cross randomize access to physical capital – namely access to WorkShop’s tools and production facilities. ~300 randomly selected individuals will be invited to use WorkShop’s tools and production facilities. These craftsmen will be offered significant discounts on the cost of utilizing resources. Craftsmen in this group will access tools in waves of ~100 to accommodate space constraints.

WorkShop will also develop a small product line for which marketing, quality control and customer service support will be offered. The sample of craftsmen who can benefit from these services is dependent on customer demand. However, we will randomly allocate ~150 craftsmen to be “certified producers” who are eligible to benefit from these services. The actual numbers treated will depend on demand for products and we will use intent to treat (ITT) analysis to assess the impacts of this treatment arm.

In particular, this project seeks to locate and survey a representative subset of approximately 7,500 individuals who attended schools that were part of a health program that provided deworming medication to more than 30,000 primary school children starting in 1998. The order of phase-in of schools involved in this health program was randomized, allowing us to estimate how exogenous gains in childhood health affect a wide range of adult life outcomes. In previous research, this intervention was shown to have substantial short-term impacts on beneficiaries (Miguel and Kremer, 2004). Despite strong a priori reasons to anticipate significant long-term labor market and demographic benefits from better childhood health, these effects have rarely been demonstrated empirically, in large part due to the near total absence of extended longitudinal data of the kind we collect. Evidence is urgently needed by public policymakers attempting to design effective health programs in less developed countries.",,,,1998-01-01,2003-12-31,"In 1998, a local non-governmental organization (NGO) launched a program known as the Primary School Deworming Program (PSDP) to provide deworming medication to individuals enrolled in 75 primary schools in Busia District, a densely-settled farming region of rural western Kenya adjacent to Lake Victoria. The schools participating in the program consisted of nearly all rural primary schools in Budalangi and Funyula divisions in southern Busia district, and contained more than 30,000 pupils at the start of the study. Baseline parasitological surveys conducted by the Kenyan Ministry of Health indicated that these divisions had high rates of helminth infection at over 90%. Using modified WHO infection thresholds (Brooker et al., 2000b), roughly one-third of children in the sample had “moderate to heavy” infections with at least one helminth at the time of the baseline survey, a rate not atypical by regional standards (Brooker et al., 2000a). The 1998 Kenya DHS indicated that 85% of children in western Kenya, in the relevant age range of 8-18 years, were enrolled in school – suggesting that the sample was broadly representative of western Kenyan children as a whole at the time.

The 75 program schools were randomly divided into three groups (Groups 1, 2, and 3) of 25 schools each: the schools were stratified by geographical area (division, then zone), the zones were listed alphabetically (within each division), and then within each zone the schools were listed in increasing order of student enrolment, and every third school was assigned to a given project group. Due to the NGO’s administrative and financial constraints, the schools were phased into the program over the course of 1998-2001, and the order of phase-in was randomly determined, creating experimental treatment groups.

",,,,"In 1998, a local non-governmental organization (NGO) launched a program known as the Primary School Deworming Program (PSDP) to provide deworming medication to individuals enrolled in 75 primary schools in Busia District, a densely-settled farming region of rural western Kenya adjacent to Lake Victoria. The schools participating in the program consisted of nearly all rural primary schools in Budalangi and Funyula divisions in southern Busia district, and contained more than 30,000 pupils at the start of the study. The 75 program schools were randomly divided into three groups (Groups 1, 2, and 3) of 25 schools each: the schools were stratified by geographical area (division, then zone), the zones were listed alphabetically (within each division), and then within each zone the schools were listed in increasing order of student enrolment, and every third school was assigned to a given project group. Due to the NGO’s administrative and financial constraints, the schools were phased into the program over the course of 1998-2001, and the order of phase-in was randomly determined, creating experimental treatment groups.

",,,2010-02-01,2010-05-31,"This evaluation took place in four countries. In Guatemala, India, and Uganda the researchers conducted smaller-scale studies which tested a subset of the hypotheses listed above. In Kenya, a wider set of hypotheses were tested. In Kenya, the health product studied was rubber shoes for children, a simple technology which could be effective in preventing soil-transmitted helminths (STHs). The study involved four main experimental treatments. First, we estimated how much people’s demand for health products falls as price increases by providing households with a coupon offering a random discount on the shoes (5, 15, 25, 35, 55, or 65 Ksh). Second, to measure the impact of information on health investment, they randomly selected half of the households to receive an information script on the symptoms of worms, transmission pathways, and on several strategies to prevent worms, including wearing shoes, using pit latrines, and maintaining proper hygiene. Third, to measure the role of liquidity, we provided households with randomly varying cash payments. Fourth, to measure whether there were differences within the household in terms of willingness to invest in health technology, we randomly selected either the husband or the wife to receive the intervention.

A baseline survey was administered to all sampled households, administrative records from the shops were collected (along with the redeemed coupons, which were pre-printed with the household’s ID number), and a follow-up survey was conducted with a randomly selected subset of the households about three months after the baseline, once the redemption period had ended. ","- Knowledge about intestinal worms
- Demand for specified rubber shoes (measured in number of purchase)",,,,"Our main experiment was conducted in the Busia and Samia Districts of Western Kenya from February to May, 2010. In our sample, parents reported that 23% of their children had a worm infection in the previous year. To obtain as representative a sample of households as possible, a door-to-door census was conducted with 1,547 households in two villages located roughly 11 kilometers apart (Ikonzo and
Bhukulungu). The census collected basic information, including whether the household had a male or female head, the number of children in the household, and the GPS location of the household. With this data, we created 51 geographic clusters based on the GPS coordinates, and randomly selected 1,069 households for project participation, stratified by geographic cluster. We were able to interview 999 of these (93.4%).

We implemented four main experimental treatments, all cross-cut against each other. All treatments were conducted after administering a baseline survey (discussed below), and obtaining informed consent. First, we estimate an experimental demand curve by implementing a methodology based on Kremer and Miguel (2007), Cohen and Dupas (2010), Dupas (2009), and Ashraf, Berry, and Shapiro (2010). In particular, we visited households and provided them with a coupon offering a random discount on the shoes. The market price at the time was about 85 Ksh ($1.13), and we provided households with coupons for 5, 15, 25, 35, 55, or 65 Ksh. Coupons were valid for a period of about 2 months. Then, to measure the impact of information on health investment, we randomly selected half of the households to receive an information script on the symptoms of worms, transmission pathways, and on several strategies to prevent infection, including wearing shoes, using pit latrines, and hygiene. We used a script, rather than a more involved educational seminar, because results from our earlier studies in Guatemala, India, and Uganda suggested that a script had similar impacts to a seminar. To measure the role of liquidity, we provided households with randomly varying cash payments. As part of our baseline survey, we elicited risk and time preferences for all households using standard laboratory techniques. For the risk preference questions, households were given a series of choices in which they could decide how much to invest (out of 40 Ksh or 100 Ksh) in an asset which paid out three times the amount invested with probability 0.5 and nothing with probability 0.5. For the time preference questions, households were given the option of accepting 40 Ksh immediately or a larger amount in the future. Lastly, to measure whether there are differences within the household in the willingness to invest in health technology in households with both a female and male head, we randomly selected either the husband or the wife for the intervention.

There are three main pieces of data that we use to evaluate the program. First, at baseline, we administered a background survey to all sampled households. In addition to standard demographic questions, we collected information on child health, worm exposure, and shoe ownership. We also collected information on household knowledge of worms, transmission pathways, and prevention strategies at the end of the survey. After the survey, we paid households their random cash payout and gave them a coupon which could be redeemed at a local shop for the price indicated. The shops were located in market centers that households would typically visit regularly for shopping (approximately 1.5 kilometers away from the average household). The coupon was pre-printed with the household’s ID number on it, so that any redeemed coupon could be matched to our household data. We hired an enumerator to supervise the redemption and maintain a log containing the name of the person redeeming the coupon, the number of coupons redeemed at one time, and the sizes of the shoes purchased. Lastly, we conducted a follow-up survey with 379 randomly selected households once the redemption period had ended (about 3 months after the first coupons had been given out). The follow-up survey included questions on shoe usage, as well as the same module used to measure worm knowledge in the baseline.",,Randomization done in office by a computer.,"Household level for treatment 1 (coupon offering a random discount on the shoes: price of 5, 15, 25, 35, 55, or 65 Ksh),
Household level for treatment 2 (information script on the symptoms of worms, transmission pathways, strategies to prevent worms),

H1: Legal aid increases use of the judiciary

Primary:

• How many times did you meet with a lawyer?

• Case filed in court?

• Outcome reached? (1=yes, whatever it is, 0=no -9999) (all from legal aid database) 

Secondary 1: legal aid improves perception of the judiciary:

• F1043: “I am confident that the legal system will uphold my contracts and property rights in a land conflict.”

• On a scale of 1 to 5, in resolving land conflicts, do you believe your country’s court system to: f1037 Be fair and impartial f1040 Be affordable f1038 Be honest and incorrupt f1041 Be consistent f1039 Be quick (deal with cases in timely manner) f1042 Have its decisions enforced

• F1058 “In the last three years, access to the courts has increased”

• F1069-F1076: Perceptions of costs associated with the judiciary should decrease.

Secondary 2: Treated individuals should use more formal means of conflict resolution, while decreasing the use of informal (especially violent) mechanisms

• The responses for “Codes for Protecting Land” to questions f757-f762 (Have you done anything to protect your land from land grabbing and/or theft?”) should change: From 00. Nothing 01. Plant trees on boundary 02. Put up barbed wire/mesh wire 03. Put up electric fence 04. Get guard dog(s) 05. Fence 06. Hire security guard 07. Activate a security light during the night 09.

• Responses to hypothetical scenarios f1059-f1068 should change as follows: “Imagine that you have the title deed to your shamba, and then your neighbor attempts to grab the land in your shamba. What would you do to try to stop your neighbor from grabbing your land?” From 00. Do Nothing 01. Talk to the land grabbing neighbor 02. Call your friends/family to come and help you 03. Hire a witch-doctor to curse your neighbor 04. Talk to village elders 05. Talk to block leader 06. Talk to sub-chief/chief 08. Hire a justice vigilante 10. Try and incite mob justice/use violence 12.

Secondary 3: Legal aid reduces perception of need for “side payments”

Questions f1044-f1057

Secondary 4: Legal aid improves legal knowledge

Questions F3186-F3200

H2: Legal aid increases security of property rights

Primary:

• Expectations that “the size of future land holdings due to conflict and/or land distribution will decrease” should decrease for the treatment group (F3125-F3148)

Secondary

• Do you have the right to sell/rent/take loans/cultivate/leave in a will/gift this plot without/with approval from your family? (F3149-F3185)

• Treated households should make greater use of formal title deeds (F738: “Into how many formal title deeds is this homestead divided?”

• F757-762: “Have you done anything to protect your land from land grabbing and/or theft?” (the answer “use title deed” should appear more in treated households)

• f773 Fencing (in ksh) should decrease

• Safety: f1088 How safe do you feel outside of your homestead during the night? f1090 How safe do you feel inside your homestead during the night? f1089 How safe do you feel outside of your homestead during the day? f1091 How safe do you feel inside your homestead during the day? 

H3: Legal aid increases agricultural investment

• Variables f3160 – f3181 in the “Land Improvements” section

• Section Land inputs as well: • F766: animal manure collected • F767: manure purchased • F768: chemical fertilizer • F769: seeds • F770: pesticides • F771: mechanical inputs • F772: other non-labour farm inputs

H4: Legal aid increases access to credit

Increased security of property rights should lead to an increase in the use of property as collateral and hence and increase in access to formal lines credit.

• We would expect to see significant increases in the following formal means of financing: • F3055-3060: employer or landlord • F3069-3074: microfinance institution • F3083-3088: bank or government agency • F3111-3116: SACCO

• Conversely, legal aid should have no significant impact on informal means of lending: • F2999-3004: family member from same HH • F3013-3018: family member from different HH • F3027-3032: friend from same village • F3041-3046: ROSCA / Merry GO Round 

H5: Legal aid increases agricultural production 

• There should be significant increases in the selling of agricultural commodities (both at market and to brokers) in ksh as specified under the “Household Sales and Consumption” section f785-f957

• More agricultural inputs should increase the marginal product of on-farm labor. Hence, the amount of labor used on the farms of legal aid recipients should increase . This results in a greater number of working days each of the following individuals in the past month have worked have done on the farm: • F774: household head (HHH) • F775: spouse of HHH • F776: HHH’s children • F1195: HHH’s parents • F777: HHH’s in-laws • F1196: HHH’s siblings • F778: HHH’s siblings in law • F779: other family / relatives of HHH • F780: non-family hired labour • F784: friends • F781-782: Other

• Treated households should be significantly more confident that they will not experience a food shortage next year (f385-f386). 

• Household identity: less casual work for others, less formal work, more work on own farm (less diversification of activities)

H6: Legal aid improves well-being, locus of control, and trust in others

• Legal aid recipients should experiences changes in measures from the PSS-10, ICD10, and WHO5 questioning corresponding to decreased feelings of depression and anxiety and increased loci of control.

• The following worries should also decrease: • F275: problems at home with relatives • F279: not enough money for food • F280: not enough money for education • F281: not enough money for living expense • F282: not enough money for medicines and medical treatment • F284: idleness of children or spouse • F286: debts owed to a family member • F287: debts owed to others

• f1087 Do you think most people would try to take advantage of you if they got a chance, or would they try to be fair?

• Response values measuring trust in the following groups of people should significantly increase (1. Distrust completely → 5. Trust completely): • F1092: nuclear family • F1093: friends • F1094: co-workers • F1095: people of another religion • F1096: rich people in community • F1097: poor people in community • F1098: political leaders • F1099: people from same clan • F1100: other clan • F1101: other ethnicities • F1102: policemen • F1103: government workers ",,,"We recruit households involved in cases with legal merit, and willing to receive legal aid. Once a case is deemed justiciable, we randomize it with a 50/50 probability into either the treatment or control group.","Providing free legal aid to the treatment group is the focus of the current project. A team of paralegals first identifies potential participants by visiting the universe of households door to door following existing maps, and asking if they are involved in legal conflicts and wish to receive legal aid. Individuals answering yes to both questions automatically enter the pool of participants. Additionally, each of these participants are asked if they have friends with legal conflicts. These friends are also visited to determine their eligibility in the project. We also visit church leaders, block leaders, chiefs, and village elders to provide us with a list people involved in conflicts. After receiving the contact information of these people, we then proceed to visit them at their homes and determine their eligibility (engaged in a conflict and desire to receive legal aid). Paralegals collect basic data on the case, and forwards the case to the office.

A lawyerThe correct word is advocate in Kenyan law, but we use lawyer out of simplicity. then determines the eligibility of the case together with the paralegals. Only cases that have legal merit are considered. Factors determining whether or not a case has indeed legal merit include: 1- the respondent’s understanding of the case; 2- the availability of supporting documents; 3- when the conflict arose (cases dating back to the 70s are excluded); 4- any actions the respondent has taken so far in resolving the conflict (to judge the pro activeness of people), and finally; 5- the nature of the conflict itself (Elimu does not handle criminal cases). Legal merit is judged by the paralegal in the field, and in a meeting with the lawyer and all paralegals present.

2.2 Randomization

Once a case is deemed justiciable, we randomize it with a 50/50 probability into either the treatment or control group, without any stratification, on a purely individual basis, on the computer in the office of Prof. Chemin.","we randomize justiciable cases with a 50/50 probability into either the treatment or control group, without any stratification, on a purely individual basis, on the computer in the office of Prof. Chemin.",The unit of randomization is the hosuehold.,,The planned sample size is 344.,"The planned sample size is 172 in the treatment group, 172 in the control group.","Each participant in the treatment group of 172 individuals will receive legal aid from paralegals 2 days valued at 600 Ksh/day*2 days=1,200 Ksh, and from the volunteer advocate 52 days/172 particpants= 0.3 days at 6200 Ksh/day, hence 1,875 Ksh. This corresponds to an overall aid of 3,075 Ksh. Baseline data indicates that yearly household expenses are 78048 Ksh (approximately 1 CAD/capita/day). We are thus interested in detecting an increase of at least 3,075 Ksh on household expenditure, otherwise the benefits, despite being statistically significant, would be less than the costs of the intervention. Statistical power calculations indicate that this sample size is enough to detect such an increase in household expenditures.","Name: McGill University Ethics Review

",,,2005-05-01,2006-11-30,"We evaluated three nested interventions that addressed the large class sizes and heterogeneity in student preparation in the Kenyan school system: (1) the addition of locally hired contract teachers to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio (ETP program);  (2) the sorting of students by initial level of preparedness to reduce heterogeneity within the classroom (Tracking); and (3) the empowerment of parents within PTA committees through School-Based Management training (SBM).

(1) Extra Teacher Program (ETP): The ETP program provided funding to hire a local contract teacher to address classroom overcrowding. In each school, a meeting was held with parents and teachers to explain the program rules regarding the hiring of an additional teacher. School committees were responsible for hiring the contract teachers and were free to replace or keep the original contract teacher based on performance. The contract teachers were paid approximately one-quarter of the salary of regular civil service teachers, but had the same educational qualifications.

(2) Tracking: While in half of the ETP schools (the ""non-tracking ETP schools""), students were divided into sections at random, in the other half (the ""tracking ETP schools""), students were divided into sections based on students' level of preparedness (as measured by exam scores during the first term).

(3) School-Based Management (SBM) training:The training was designed to empower parents (within the PTA committee) to ensure a fair and objective recruiting process for the ETP teacher, as well as to monitor teachers' performance.

Two sections were created for grade 1, one taught by regular civil service teachers (with multiple teachers rotating in an out of the class, teaching different subjects) and one taught exclusively by the contract teacher. As a result, average class size in grade 1 was only 44 in ETP schools, compared to 82 in comparison schools. In the second year of the program, the ETP teacher moved to grade 2, such that the cohort of first graders that benefitted from the ETP program continued to benefit once in grade 2.

While in half of the ETP schools (the ""non-tracking ETP schools""), students were divided into sections at random, in the other half (the ""tracking ETP schools""), students were divided into sections based on students' level of preparedness (as measured by exam scores during the first term). For all schools, which section was taught by the ETP contract teacher was then decided by random draw.

Finally, half of the schools assigned to ETP, including both tracking and non-tracking schools, were randomly selected to receive School-Based Management (SBM) training.

Others argue that resources will have limited impact without systematic reforms to education governance, teacher incentives, and pedagogy. We examine a program under which school committees at randomly selected Kenyan schools were funded to hire an additional teacher on an annual contract renewable conditional on performance, outside normal Ministry of Education civil-service channels, at one-quarter normal compensation levels. For students randomly assigned to stay with existing classes, test scores did not increase significantly, despite a reduction in class size from 82 to 44 on average. In contrast, scores increased for students assigned to be taught by locally hired contract teachers. One reason may be that contract teachers had low absence rates, while centrally-hired civil-service teachers in schools randomly assigned contract teachers endogenously reduced their effort. Civil-service teachers also captured rents for their families, with approximately 1/3 of contract teacher positions going to relatives of existing teachers. A governance program that empowered parents within school committees reduced both forms of capture. The best contract teachers obtained civil service jobs over time, and we estimate large potential dynamic benefits from supplementing a civil service system with locally-hired contract teachers brought in on a probationary basis and granted tenure conditional on performance.

Abstract: To the extent that students benefit from high-achieving peers, tracking will help strong students and hurt weak ones. However, all students
may benefit if tracking allows teachers to better tailor their instruction level. Lower-achieving pupils are particularly likely to benefit from tracking when teachers have incentives to teach to the top of the distribution. We propose a simple model nesting these effects and test its implications in a randomized tracking experiment conducted with 121 primary schools in Kenya. While the direct effect of high-achieving peers is positive, tracking benefited lower-achieving pupils indirectly by allowing teachers to teach to their level.

In the agricultural context, if farmers do not observe each others' inputs, diffusion of both information on the optimal input mix and of the technology itself may be slow. In a large-scale field experiment, we introduced a simple and salient tool, a blue measuring spoon, to help farmers remember how much fertilizer to use. A randomly selected subset of farmers received the technology for free, and the remaining farmers could purchase it at fertilizer stores at a nominal price. Farmers who were randomly assigned to receive a measuring spoon subsequently improved knowledge of how much fertilizer to use, and were more likely to use fertilizer. Unlike fertilizer adoption itself, purchase and use of measuring spoons diffused rapidly through social networks. We find that the formation of farmers' cooperatives sped the diffusion of the spoons.

The experiment was conducted with small-scale farmers over two agricultural seasons (short rains 2010 and long rains 2011). To reach a large number of farmers at affordable costs, we leveraged a large social network: the parents of school children in 184 rural primary schools. Children in these schools were given a letter inviting their parents inviting them to a meeting at the school. Every parent who participated in a meeting at a particular school was eligible for the treatment administered at this school. At the meeting, the experimental treatments (if any) were explained, and enumerators completed a short baseline survey with each participant. We enrolled approximately 27,000 farmers into the program.

We cross-randomized three main treatments. First, we subsidized the creation of farmers' cooperatives in which farmers could discuss agricultural issues. Second, we provided farmers with time-limited coupons which could be redeemed for a small discount on the cost of fertilizer. Third, we provided a randomly selected subset of farmers with 1/2 teaspoon measuring spoons, painted blue, which could be used to measure out a quantity of fertilizer which we found profit-maximizing in prior work (Duflo et al. 2008). 
","adoption of fertilizer, adoption of bluespoons, redemption of coupons, membership in agricultural cooperatives",,,,"At the school level, we cross-randomized farmers at the school level into two main treatment conditions. First, to lower costs of communicating and sharing knowledge about fertilizer and other agricultural practices, we encouraged farmers to form farmers' cooperatives to talk about agriculture. While we facilitated organizing the groups and coordinated the first few meetings, we did not provide any information directly to farmers.

Second, in previous work, we found that providing farmers with small incentives to invest in fertilizer when they have money (right after harvest) can substantially increase usage (Duflo et al. 2011). Hence, to increase usage exogenously, we implemented a scalable version of a program to provide farmers with small, time-limited discounts which were valid within a short window (3 to 4 weeks) right after harvest, redeemable at a local shop. Farmers received coupons for a discount of 15% of the price of fertilizer. The coupon was valid for discounts to either diammonium phosphate fertilizer (DAP), used at planting, and calcium ammonium nitrate fertilizer (CAN), used at top dressing, when the maize plant is knee high, approximately one to two months after planting. Farmers could choose any combination of DAP and CAN up to 25 kilograms in total. Moreover, to evaluate the eectiveness of text message reminders, we randomly selected half of the schools that received fertilizer discount coupons into a text message reminder program. In these schools, we randomized a subset of individuals who either owned a cellphone or had access to a cellphone to receive a text message reminder two days before the expiration date of their time-limited discount.

At each school meeting, we asked about 25% of farmers in each school to provide names and contact information of up to 3 individuals outside their own household with whom they discussed agriculture whom we refer to as agricultural contacts"" below. About two thirds of these individuals were randomly selected to receive a ""Bluespoon,"" a half-teaspoon, painted blue, which farmers could use to apply fertilizer to their maize. We chose this simple technology because in earlier work we had found 1/2 teaspoon of CAN to yield the highest profits on average among four different quantities (Duflo et al. 2008). We delivered these spoons in an additional short meeting
(at the same schools) to which we had invited the randomly selected subset of farmers. In addition, farmers were given the information that in earlier work we had found that this quantity of CAN resulted in the highest prots on average.

Before the offer, each account was randomly assigned to qualify for one of four temporary, six-month interest rates. An individual account could bear 0, 2, 6, or 10 percent 6-month yields and joint accounts could bear 2, 6 or 10 percent 6-month interest rates. The interest rates were purposely chosen to exceed market rates by a large margin, with the hope that they would encourage account use and increase savings. After the six-month interest rate expired, researchers measured take-up, account use, savings behavior, and economic impacts for individual and joint account holders. Researchers measured the same outcomes again after another two and a half years to understand the long-term effects of the interest rate subsidies.

In order to test whether the ability to hide savings was an important driver of individual account use, 50 percent of participating couples were randomly selected for an ""extra statements"" offer. If a selected couple decided to open an individual account for (without loss of generality) spouse A , the enumerator processing the couple’s paperwork asked if the spouses would consent to allow spouse B to receive extra statement cards. The cards, if presented by spouse B at the bank, entitled him or her to learn the current balance of spouse A ’s account.

OECD countries provided USD 135 billion in official development assistance (OECD,

In this study, we examine the role of such inefficiencies in the adoption of a new food safety technology, Aflasafe. Aflasafe has been shown to reduce aflatoxin contamination in maize by approximately 90%. However, this technology faces several barriers to widespread adoption. First, since Aflasafe is applied while the crop is still growing, its use increases farmers’ exposure to yield risk. In the absence of a market for crop insurance, this may limit its adoption. Second, the lack of price incentives for food safety in markets served by smallholder maize producers in Kenya may constrain the adoption of food safety technologies by these farmers. In this study, we explore the impact on adoption of Aflasafe of 1) bundling the product with a rainfall index based money-back guarantee, and 2) access to an output market that rewards aflatoxin safety.

They will also be given an opportunity to buy Aflasafe, which is not currently available in the study area. These groups will further be divided into two treatment conditions concerning money back guarantee (MBG): an Optional condition, offered the option to buy Aflasafe either with or without the MBG, and a Bundled condition, in which Aflasafe is only offered in combination with the MBG. The Money Back Guarantee treatment will be crossed with the Output Market Linkage treatment, which consists of a linkage between the farmer group and a buyer that pays a premium for safe maize. Hence, in total there will be five categories, including the pure control group, and four treatment groups (Optional MBG / Output linkage , Optional MBG / No output linkage, Bundled MBG / Output linkage, and Bundled MBG / No output linkage).","1.

Farmers’ adoption decisions will be measured by a dummy variable, equal to 1 if the farmer adopted and 0 if the farmer did not adopt. The intensity of adoption will be measured as the amount of Aflasafe purchased. Both the binary and intensity adoption variables will be constructed using Aflasafe sales data. 

2.	Aflatoxin contamination and Aflasafe usage:
Samples of maize will be taken from the following three sources:
1)	Maize stored for household consumption
2)	Maize stored for later sale
3)	Maize aggregated for testing and sale through the study
Samples will be tested for aflatoxin using a quantitative test with an upper detection limit of 150 ppb. In the event that more than 5% of samples are at or above the upper limit of the detection range, these will be diluted and re-analyzed, to a maximum detection level of 400. A microbiological test will be used to assess whether Aflasafe was used on a batch of maize. Selection of one or both aflatoxin contamination and/or Aflasafe usage depends on the relative costs and efficiency of these two indicators for assessing farmer behavior.",,,"Farmer groups are drawn from a list of 250 farmer groups obtained from the Cereal Growers Association and county Ministries of Agriculture. Based on power calculations, we allocated 160 farmer groups across the four treatment groups and the control group as follows: Optional MBG / Output linkage: 38, Optional MBG / No output linkage: 38, Bundled MBG / Output linkage: 38, and Bundled MBG / No output linkage: 38; Pure Control: 8.
In order to limit spillovers across money back guarantee treatments, we created comparable, but geographically distinct, clusters of farmer groups within each of the study counties (4 in Meru, 2 in Tharaka-Nithi and 2 in Embu) and subsequently assigned these clusters to either the bundled or the optional MBG treatment. Subject to a minimum geographical distance of 5 km between clusters, we aimed to select similar farmer groups into the clusters within each county. Similarity was defined based on the Euclidean distance in the six-dimensional space formed by the standardized values of variables listed in section 5.4. 
To this end, we first dropped clusters close to the county borders to achieve a minimum distance of groups in different counties of at least 5 km. Subsequently, we excluded any groups within a 5 km bands dividing the remaining groups into similarly-sized clusters. The direction of this band was selected to minimize the Euclidean distance between the groups on either side of it. From the remaining groups, we then iteratively selected matched pairs across each cluster with the lowest Euclidean distance into the sample. To ensure that the MBG treatments were spread out geographically, we manually decided which clusters would receive the same treatment. Finally, we randomly assigned the bundled MBG to one of the two groups of clusters.
Within each of the money back guarantee clusters, the market linkage treatment was randomly assigned at the village level.

",,,2003-02-01,2004-11-30,"This evaluation tested two interventions to reduce risky sexual behavior: training teachers on the existing HIV curriculum, and reducing the costs of schooling by providing free uniforms. The 328 study schools were randomly assigned to one of four groups of about 82 schools. Each of the four groups of schools received a different set of programs:

In groups 2 and 4, three teachers were trained on HIV/AIDS and on how to teach the HIV curriculum. The curriculum covers facts about the disease, and encourages abstinence until marriage and faithfulness afterwards. It also teaches life skills, such as how to say ""no"" to unwanted or unsafe sexual relations.

In groups 2 and 3, children already enrolled in sixth grade classes were given a free uniform. Implementers also announced that students still enrolled in school the following year would be eligible for a second uniform, and distributed uniforms again the following year.

All in all, group 1 received no program at all and thus served as the comparison group, group 2 received the teacher training program only, group 3 schools received the uniforms program only, and group 4 schools received both programs.

To evaluate the impact of the two programs on sexual behavior and sexual health, survey data was collected on youths' sexual behavior. Such survey data can be subject to reporting biases, however. It was therefore important to complement this data with an objective measure of the incidence of unprotected sex, which is the main mode of HIV transmission in Kenya. Two such measures were considered: (1) childbearing rates and (2) sexually transmitted infection rates. Childbearing rates were monitored regularly between 2003 and 2010. STI infection rates (specifically, Herpes and HIV infection rates) were measured during a long-term follow-up in 2009-2010.","- Duration of student enrolment in school
- Incidence of teen marriage 
- Incidence of teen pregnancy
- HSV2 infection",,,,"We study two programs implemented through a partnership between the non-governmental organization ICS Africa, the Kenyan Ministry of Education, the Kenya Institute of Education, and the Kenya National AIDS Control Council. The first program reduced the cost of education by providing free school uniforms. The second program trained teachers on how to deliver the national HIV/AIDS prevention curriculum to upper primary school students. We also evaluate a small add-on component to the government-run teacher training designed to foster the discussion of condoms, in order to check whether an explicit discussion of condoms in a curriculum otherwise focused on abstinence and fidelity could affect behavior.

The study took place in all 328 public primary schools in 7 divisions of 2 districts of Western Kenya: Butere-Mumias and Bungoma. None of these schools had participated in any prior randomized evaluation that we know of. All schools agreed to participate. Schools were stratified and assigned to one of four arms using a random number generator: (i) Control (82 schools); (ii) Stand-alone education subsidy program (83 schools); (iii) Stand-alone HIV education program (83 schools); (iv) Joint program (80 schools). Between February and July 2003, ICS distributed free school uniforms to boys and girls enrolled in sixth grade at the onset of the school year (January). In fall 2004, ICS distributed a second uniform to the same students, if they were still enrolled in the same school (regardless of their grade). It was announced at the onset of the program that students still enrolled in the same school would be eligible for a second uniform after 18 months. The total education subsidy, delivered over two years, amounted to just around $12 per student, or 2.5 percent of average annual household income in the study area at the time. 

In 2002 the Kenya government started a large-scale effort to train teachers on HIV education, based in part on data suggesting that in the absence of training, many teachers were uncomfortable teaching the official HIV/AIDS curriculum. In 2003, ICS Africa helped implement the national training program for 184 primary schools by providing logistical and financial support. The 184 schools selected for the HIV Education program were asked to send three upper primary teachers to participate in a five-day training program. The training sessions were conducted jointly by one facilitator from the AIDS Control Unit of the Ministry of Education (MoE), two facilitators from the Kenya Institute of Education (KIE), and one trained staff member from ICS Africa. Teacher training included basic facts on HIV/AIDS, a condom demonstration, information on voluntary counseling and testing, and HIV/AIDS education methodology. Because training was primarily done by MoE and KIE staff and was based on the officially approved curriculum, the content should be similar to that delivered in other parts of Kenya. At the same time, since the sessions were facilitated and observed by ICS Africa and members of the research team, we do know they were well run and teacher attendance was good. 

In addition to receiving training on how to deliver HIV information in the classroom, teachers were advised to set up health clubs to deliver HIV information outside of the classroom. Since the curriculum leaves almost no space for teachers to provide information about condoms, we were interested in testing whether exploiting the existing window to the maximum extent possible would affect the impact of teacher training on student knowledge and behavior. This is important for policy, since only an intervention taking place within the existing curriculum could be potentially scaled up (if effective) without major rethinking. From the perspective of understanding adolescent behavior, it was also important to try to generate exogenous variation in awareness of condoms (a potential way to protect oneself against both STI and pregnancy) without affecting access to condoms. Thus, during the school year 2005, two years after the implementation of the education subsidy and HIV education teacher training, a random subset of schools that had participated in the teacher training were sampled for an additional intervention called “critical thinking” (CT). This add-on was targeted at students in seventh and eighth grades in 2005 (many of whom, given the high repetition rate, were in sixth grade in 2003, i.e., in our study cohort). Schools sampled for CT were encouraged to organize a debate on the motion, “School children should be taught how to use condoms,” a motion suggested in the official Facilitators’ Handbook (KIE 1999, p. 66). The debate was followed by an essay competition on the theme: “Discuss ways in which you can protect yourself from HIV infection now and at later ages in your life.” Both debates and essay writing are established practices in Kenyan schools, and teachers agreed to organize these activities in 95 percent of sampled schools. At the time, none of these schools had previously organized a debate or essay competition on these specific topics, which suggests that these topics were most likely never discussed in non-CT schools, and thus the CT encouragement appears to have created the intended exogenous gap in students exposure.",,Randomization done in office by a computer,School,328 schools ,"19,289 students","Control group 1: 82 schools received no program at all

This design allows me to control for selection into training while still allowing me to test whether workers are willing to invest in it. Below I describe my research setting, the population of agents in my study, the experimental treatment groups, and the provision of training to agents in the treatment groups.

Research Setting:

I ran my experiment in Northern Kenya in collaboration with Index Based Livestock Insurance (IBLI), a project group that operates out of the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) in Nairobi, Kenya, and Takaful Insurance of Africa (TIA), the largest Sharia compliant insurance company in East and Central Africa. TIA distributes and underwrites IBLI in Northern Kenya. 

IBLI is an index-based insurance product that covers pastoralists in arid and semi arid regions against risk of drought related livestock losses. TIA sells IBLI to Kenyan pastoralists using an outside sales-agent model in which agents are selected in part based on their literacy, and their relationship to their local community. They are tasked with selling IBLI within their communities for a two month sales windows. Sales windows occur twice a year (from the beginning of January to the end of February, and from the beginning of August to the end of September), and there is substantial agent turnover between windows. For instance, over than 50% of agents employed for the first sales window in 2015 did not renew their contract for the second sales window. In the sales window covered by the experiment, TIA was providing IBLI in 6 counties in Northern Kenya; Garissa, Isiolo, Mandera, Marsabit, Moyale, and Wajir. Each county is divided into divisions (ranging from 4 to 16 per county), and each division is assigned one lead agent and several sub-agents.

The pastoralists who are the targets of IBLI are largely unfamiliar with and leery of the product, and with insurance in general. Over ten times more IBLI sales agents surveyed during the January-February, 2015 sales window reported that poor pastoralist education about insurance was a bigger barrier to their sales than was the cost of the insurance product. IBLI, like all insurance products, is complex, and mis-informing customers about what to expect from the coverage is illegal and can lead to further mistrust of the product within communities. Unlike many other insurance products, IBLI provided by TIA is Sharia compliant and pay-outs are based on an index tied to the Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI). Therefore, knowledge about IBLI and about TIA as a provider of Sharia compliant insurance is critical for agents to develop and maintain sales.   

Study Population

All lead and sub-agents employed by TIA to sell IBLI during the August-September, 2015 sales window are included in my sample. Lead agents are tasked with finding and training sub-agents in addition to selling the product. To help them achieve this, lead agents a three day in person training camp where they learn about IBLI, TIA, and selling in general. Sub-agents are small business owners, for instance, retail store owners or M-PESA agents, who are recruited because they have frequent contact with potential customers. Although they have sales experience as store owners, anecdotal evidence from conversations with TIA employees and lead agents suggests that they are frequently semi-literate or illiterate and have primary educations on average. Lead agents are more educated than sub-agents, on average they have some post-secondary education, but like sub-agents, they frequently have additional income earning activities and do not consider selling IBLI to be their career.

Agents are assigned to sell in the division they live in, however, they are free to sell in other divisions as well. TIA employs local workers first, because they speak the local dialects and are more likely to be trusted by the pastoralists in their community, and second, because it is difficult to recruit non-local workers to relocate to these relatively under-developed and remote regions.
 
 Experimental Treatments:

To test short-term workers are willing to invest in firm-specific knowledge, and how the provision of this knowledge affects firm performance, I randomly assigned sales agents into one of three treatment groups or a control group. Agents in all three treatment groups receive access to a mobile training application that provides training modules, quizzes, and frequently asked questions on TIA and the insurance product they are selling. One treatment group was sent a version of the training application that offers agents the opportunity to be awarded phone credit for good performance on the module quizzes. Going forward, I refer to this as the incentive group. The second treatment group was sent a version of the training application that includes game features(specifically, a leader board and badges for participation and good performance on the module quizzes). Going forward, I refer to this as the competition group. The third treatment group does not receive any additional content on their training application. Going forward, I refer to this as the basic group. Agents in the control group did not receive access to the training application. 

Agents in the incentive group were awarded KSH 250 in phone credit for each quiz for which they got at most one question wrong. Although agents can take each quiz as many times as they like, they can only be awarded phone credit once per quiz, and only for their first attempt at the quiz. Therefore, these agents could earn up to KSH 1750 from the application (about 17 USD at the time of the study). Agents in the competition group had access to a leader board on their applications that showed them how they ranked relative to all other agents (including those not in the competition group). Only agent numbers were listed on the leader board so as to protect agents' privacy. Agents in this group could also receive digital badges for completing each quiz and separately for performing well on each quiz (i.e. getting at most one question wrong). 

To avoid agents in the control knowing about the training application or gaining access to the content, and to avoid agents in one treatment group learning about other versions of the application and potentially becoming upset by the differences or becoming aware of a potential study, randomization occurred at the division level. Agents were not aware of the study, nor were they aware that there were different versions of the application or that some agents did not receive access to the application. 

 Training Provision:
  
Training was provided to agents in the treatment groups through an Android application developed by contracted computer programmers in a collaboration with TIA and IBLI. TIA began providing all agents with Android smart phones in the January-February, 2015 sales season to allow agents to record all their sales on a sales transaction application developed for IBLI sales agents. This roll-out confirmed the willingness and ability of agents to use smart phone applications. 
  
The training application was developed to provide simple, direct, and concise statements about the insurance product, and TIA. These statements are each under one of 7 training modules. At the conclusion of each training module, agents can complete a quiz on the content covered in the corresponding module. The application also includes a frequently asked questions section that agents can refer to when they are selling. This section includes 17 questions and answers which are meant to address confusion agents in previous sales windows had when selling the product. 
  
Training applications were provided to agents in the treatment groups through SMS five days before the beginning of the August-September, 2015 sales window. SMS messages included download instructions, a link to the application, and depending on which treatment group agents were in, a message about the application. In the basic treatment group, agents were told they could use this application to help them better understand IBLI and potentially improve their sales. In the incentive treatment group, agents were told the same thing but were also told they could earn phone credit by performing well on the quizzes in the training application. In the competition treatment group, agents were told what agents in the basic group were told and were also told that they could see how their performance on the training application quizzes compares with other agents, and receive badges on the application for participating in the training and performing well on the quizzes. Over the next four days, each agent in the treatment groups was contacted by phone by a researcher at IBLI and/or by TIA county coordinators who are permanent employees to determine whether they had received the app and been able to download it. In some cases, because of poor network in some areas, efforts to reach agents by phone continued after the sales window had begun.

This study seeks to understand if heterogeneity in underlying agronomic conditions is a barrier to adoption of agricultural inputs that are widely understood to have high returns.  Suri and Tjernström find evidence for this heterogeneity in both fertilizer and seeds, respectively.  To address this heterogeneity, a mobile phone information system will disseminate location-specific agricultural advice to farmers based on statistically interpolated soil chemistry content.  This intervention leverages technological scale in two ways: (1) using geospatial statistics and modern machine learning techniques to turn a relatively small number of expensive soil tests into a predictive map of continuous soil characteristics, and (2) scaling the dissemination of this precise information over the mobile phone in a way that would be cost prohibitive for human extension agents.  Previous research by Casaburi and Cole have found mobile phones to be an effective medium to disseminate agricultural advice to positively affect farmer behavior.
	One Acre Fund has been doing soil tests in all areas of operation to better understand what inputs would be most appropriate for their farmers.  Several thousand soil tests are performed using soil spectroscopy (<$1 per sample) which are calibrated using Random Forests with a 10% percent sample of wet chemistry tests ($10-$50 per sample).  These soil chemistry results can then be interpolated using Kriging to create a continuous field of soil chemistry predictions.  Some of these soil properties interpolate better than others.  We can reliably spatially interpolate nitrogen and potassium but have a difficult time explaining variation in phosphorus spatially.  This is evident in the semi-variograms produced when estimating the parameters for the Kriging procedure.
Soil acidity (pH) is one characteristic that is spatially well-interpolated and happens to be a major issue for farmers in western Kenya.  Under a critical threshold (pH < 5.5), the maize plant will suffer from aluminum photo-toxicity.  High acidity also inhibits the absorption of other beneficial nutrients that affect plant growth.  This can be remedied by the application of agricultural lime (ground limestone) to the soil and was the key to ending rural poverty and unlocking the green revolution in rural Brazil with similar soils.  Agricultural trials run by One Acre Fund sees yield increases of up to 40% by microdosing agricultural lime.  Despite this high return and the low cost of agricultural lime, there is very low uptake of agricultural lime (<2%).  Our interpolated soil maps show a fairly high degree of variation in soil pH which makes agricultural lime hugely profitable in some areas but less so in others.  
	This trial seeks to provide this information at scale, targeting poor farmers with specific lime application recommendations over the mobile phone.  There is a group of ~4000 One Acre Fund farmers who will be randomly assigned into treatment or control.  The control group will receive no messaging and the treatment group will receive messages with location-specific recommendations for the application of agricultural lime or a general recommendation to use lime.  These messages will be sent this month (August 2016).  In September, farmers will choose which agricultural products they will purchase from One Acre Fund, including the uptake of lime.  We will compare the appropriate uptake of agricultural lime in the treatment group with the control group controlling for information spillovers and group leader effects.",,,,2016-09-14,2016-09-19,"SMS providing targeted lime recommendations to farmers in Nambale District in Busia County.

Working with the Kenyan Government, we implement a new Community Deworming Program that offers free deworming treatment to adults and explicitly emphasizes the public good aspect of deworming. We test two types of social incentives in the form of colorful bracelets and ink that adults receive upon coming for deworming. Different to most incentives that are material or private in nature (e.g. food, cash transfers) the bracelets and ink make the decision to deworm or abstain from treatment observable and allow adults to signal to others that they contributed to protecting their community from worms. We further introduce a calendar as private incentive that is comparable in its consumption value to the bracelet but cannot easily be observed by others. Communities are randomized into being eligible for the ink, calendar or bracelet or receive no incentive when coming for deworming. In a second stage, we offer free text messages to a random subset of adults living in these communities, reminding them of the availability of free deworming treatment and providing information about deworming treatment take-up in their community. The cluster randomization identifies the combined effect of social signaling, learning and reminders. The text messaging treatment allows us to separately identify the extent to which deworming decisions are driven by (i) reminder effects, (ii) social learning or (iii) the desire to signal to others. We further measure the effect of social incentives on individuals' knowledge and beliefs about others' deworming choices.",,,,2016-10-03,2016-11-04,"Working with the Government of Kenya we offer free deworming treatment to adults in 3 counties (Busia, Kakamega, Siaya) in Western Kenya. Community Health Volunteers (CHVs) provide the treatment at central locations and sensitize households about the upcoming deworming treatment. CHVs were identified as ideal agents to sensitize communities and give out deworming drugs, both because of their experience in providing health services to communities and because of their familiarity and trusted relationship with community members, allowing them to credibly convey new information (e.g. about the externality aspect of deworming) and address concerns (e.g. that deworming drugs might sterilize women). CHVs inform all study communities one week prior to the start of the deworming treatment about the social benefits of deworming, when and where free deworming treatment will be available and if applicable what type of incentive will be given to adults when coming for treatment. Deworming treatment is subsequently offered at central locations for a period of 10 days. 

We identified 150 central locations in the 3 selected counties. Central locations and their catchment areas are randomly assigned, in equal numbers, into one of four intervention arms:
1) CHVs mark adults' fingers with ink;
2) CHVs give adults a green wrist bracelet;
3) CHVs give adults a one-page calendar for 2017;
4) Only deworming treatment is provided and no incentive. 

We mapped communities that fall within a 2.5 catchment radius of the central location and randomly selected one community per catchment area. We conducted a census of all adults in those 150 communities and randomly selected 15 individuals in each control arm community to receive reminder text messages, and 15 (for control arm) or 25 (for ink/bracelet/calendar arms) individuals to receive reminder text messages that also contain information about deworming take-up in their community. Adults that signed up for the free text message service receive a text message on the day before deworming starts, on the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th and 10th day of deworming treatment. The text message service is free and individuals can unsubscribe at any time at no cost. The reminder messages contain the following content: ""Free deworming now at [Central Location]. Reply 111 to stop texts. All texts are free."" The reminder plus information about deworming take-up messages contain the following content: ""Free deworming now at [Central Location]. [No/few/almost half/half/more than half/almost all/all] of your village came, that is [X] in 10 adults. Reply 111 to stop texts. All texts are free."" To verify that adults are reading the text messages and encourage them to do so, we offer an airtime reward of 50 Kenyan Shillings (50 US Cents) to a random subset of subscribers conditional on texting back and confirming the receipt of the text message. The following reward text is sent to adults: ""Thank you for signing up for this text message from Evidence Action. To receive your 50Ksh airtime reward, message 123 to [Phone number]. The text is free."" ","Primary outcome: number of adults coming for deworming treatment. 
Secondary outcomes: individual knowledge and beliefs about others' deworming choices.",,,,"A mapping was created of the 3 counties and locations for central locations were identified such that 157 central locations could be fit into the geographic area and central locations had a catchment radius of 2.5km. Subsequently a census was conducted of all central locations and the communities falling inside the 2.5km catchment radius. A GPS mapping was created, resulting in 150 central locations. One community per central location catchment area was randomly selected, with half of the communities being less than 1.25km from the central location and half of the communities being more than 1.25km away located from the central location. All selected communities are therefore located <2.5 km from their central location and >3.5-4km from all other central locations. Central locations were then randomized into the four different intervention arms outlined in the ""Intervention"" section.

The farmer had to decide during the visit whether or not to participate in the program, and could buy any amount of fertilizer. In the second season, a new group of farmers was selected to receive the basic SAFI treatment. The second season also included additional interventions, structured as follows:

SAFI with ex ante choice of timing: A field officer visited the farmers before the harvest and offered them the opportunity to decide when, during the next growing season, they wanted the officer to return to offer them the SAFI program. They were then visited at the specified time, and offered a chance to buy a voucher for future fertilizer use (as in the Basic SAFI program, as described above).

Free delivery visit later in the season: Same as the basic SAFI intervention, but farmers were visited later in the season. A field officer visited farmers 2-4 months after the harvest (when it is time to apply fertilizer as a top-dressing to the next crop), and offered them the opportunity to buy fertilizer, at the regular price, with free delivery. 

Subsidy later in season: A field officer visited the farmers 2-4 months after the harvest (when it is time to apply fertilizer to the next crop) and offered to sell them fertilizer, at a 50 percent subsidy, with free delivery.

The project also investigates whether difficulty in saving harvest income until the time that inputs are needed is a significant barrier to adoption.

Specifically, number of survey submissions per day, accurate reporting of vegetation, quality of photo submission, whether or not submission was completed within permitted time period.",,,,"To test whether active and visible monitoring of easy-to-measure dimensions of output changes worker performance, we employed a field experiment among remote workers in rural Kenya. In this section of the paper, we describe the population of workers in our sample, our treatment groups, and the implementation of our treatments.

Study Setting and Population:

We ran our experiment on 113 workers hired to collect and transmit information on rangeland conditions in rural areas of Central Kenya over a 149 day period. Workers were located in five divisions; two in Samburu County, two in Isiolo County, and one in Laikipia County.  The data collection was part of a collaborative effort between the International Livestock Research Institute in Nairobi and Cornell University in Ithaca, New York to test the viability of information crowd-sourcing as a means for improving resource allocation among pastoralist communities (see https://www.udiscover.it/applications/pastoralism/ for more information on the purpose of the workers' tasks). Given the difficulties associated with finding labor to work in very remote regions and with the knowledge required to classify local rangelands, workers were hired from the population of pastoralists active in the region. 

In order to collect and transmit information on rangeland conditions, pastoralists were supplied with smartphones that included cameras and GPS. A crowd-sourcing mobile application was developed for the purpose of this job, and pastoralists were to submit all their data through the application. To achieve a single completed survey, workers were required to take a photo in the application and then select whether the rangeland in the photo includes any grass, trees, or bushes, and, if so, whether each is green or brown in color. In addition, workers were required to indicate carrying capacity of the rangeland for cattle. Some of the pastoralists hired for this work are not literate or fluent in English, and some are not literate in any language. To ensure literacy was not required to complete the task, workers completed each classification step by selecting images on the application that corresponded to their responses. Workers could be paid between $0.05 and $0.40 for up to ten photo and classification submissions per day depending on the location photos were taken in. Higher prices were paid for photos from more remote locations. To try to ensure that they did not submit multiple photos of the same rangeland within a short time period, photos had to be submitted one hour apart. Moreover, to ensure rangelands would be visible in the photos, submissions had to be recorded between 7 am and 6 pm. Submissions that did not meet these qualifications were not paid for. Workers received three days of intensive training on the use of the smartphone, the application, and the task. They were employed on this job between March and August of 2015, and none of the workers were fired for any reason. 

There are several dimensions of data submission quality that are relatively easy to verify, and several that are quite difficult. In particular, the location of the photo, the time it was taken, whether it had been previously submitted, and which classifications were made are automatically recorded with the data and easy to verify as a result. Location and time of the photo are particularly important to verify because payment is conditional on these characteristics. In contrast, the accuracy of the classifications made and the quality of the photo are difficult to verify because of the large quantity of data submitted. Workers may have an incentive to misclassify photos to reduce the time it takes to submit each one, for instance because choosing the first option on each screen in the application would be faster than choosing the correct option, or to submit quickly taken, poor quality photos. In addition, if they believe that aid to the region would be affected by the crowdsourcing effort, then they may have an incentive to classify photos as indicating rangeland conditions are worse than they are in reality. 

Experimental Interventions:

To test whether increasing the visibility and activity of monitoring on some task dimensions affected the performance of workers, we introduced two managerial treatments. Workers assigned the first treatment, which we will hereafter refer to as the ""managerial activity"" treatment, received a call from their manager every five days. During the call, the manager told each worker how many submissions they had made the previous day, and how many of those submissions were classified as having grass in them. The manager did not give workers any evaluation-based feedback on the quality or quantity of data received, and in particular, did not tell workers whether the photos were correctly specified as having grass in them. Workers assigned the second treatment, which we will hereafter refer to as the ""monitoring"" treatment, also received a call from their manager every five days. The beginning of the call was identical to the call in the managerial activity treatment. However, workers in this treatment group were also told which submissions from the prior day had correctly and incorrectly classified the presence of grass in the photo. In addition, the manager told workers how many submissions from the prior day included poor quality photos and were reminded that photos should be taken during the day, not be blurry, and capture a wide scene. The precise scripts the manager read workers in the respective treatments are as follows:

Managerial Activity Treatment: ""Our records show that yesterday you completed and submitted [xx] surveys and that in [yy] of those surveys you indicated that there was grass""

Monitoring Treatment: ""Our records show that yesterday you submitted [xx] surveys and that in [yy] of those surveys you indicated that there was grass.   When we examined the photos. We agree with your grass categorization in [z1] cases but disagree in [z2] cases.  Do you remember why you might have said there was no grass when there was grass or some grass when there was none in the photo? Our records also show that there were [z3] cases in which the photo was of very poor quality.  Please remember that photos must be taken during the day, not be blurry, and you must stand back from objects so that the photo captures a wide scene""

The manager was instructed not to give any additional feedback or comments on the workers' performance or submissions and to make notes of all questions and comments from the workers during these calls.

Study Implementation:

Both the managerial activity and the monitoring treatments were assigned to 34 workers in the study population, and the remaining 45 workers did not receive any phone calls from the local manager. Treatments were randomly assigned within each division to ensure that each division has workers in all three groups. Each day, the manager called all workers in the treatment groups in a single division resulting in one division being called per day. These calls began 43 days into the study period. To test whether the treatments continued to have effects after the calls stopped and whether the stickiness of the treatments depends on how long the treatment period is, we phased the calls out gradually. Specifically, we dropped 25% of the treatment group from the call list at a time with the first 25% being dropped 52 days after the start of the treatments and each subsequent 25% dropped after 15 days.  All calls stopped 15 days before the end of the study period.

At the beginning of the study period, workers were surveyed by their local manager. The questionnaire asked about their educational and work backgrounds, their demographics, and their normal phone use. Workers were told that their activities would be used to study the viability of crowdsourcing for improving information on range land conditions and related topics, but did not know that we were studying questions related to worker management or that managerial interventions were being randomly assigned.",,Randomization done in office by a computer,Division,113 workers,113 workers,"45 workers control, 34 workers managerial activity treatment, 34 workers monitoring treatment",Number of submissions per day: need a minimum detectable standardized effect size of 0.27 submissions between treatment and control using the pre-intervention period mean of 10.04 and standard deviation of 3.23 at the 5% level with a power of 80%.,,,2015-08-31,True,2015-08-31,113,False,113,"34 in check-in treatment, 34 in monitoring treatment, 45 in control",False,,False,,,"Abstract: Credible monitoring of remote workers presents unique challenges that may reduce the benefits of formal organization for their management. We consider whether increasing the salience of monitor productivity without changing incentive contracts or monitoring technology leads to changes in remote worker performance. Results from a field experiment run among multi-dimensional task workers in Kenya demonstrate that increasing the visibility of monitor activity improves performance on task dimensions not being directly paid for. Our evidence is consistent with the importance of conspicuous monitoring when managers and workers are not co-located.

Proponents argue that a UBI has the potential to eliminate extreme poverty and to counteract the harmful effects of rising inequality in wealthier countries. Interest has surged, with UBI actively debated in countries ranging from Switzerland and Finland to Namibia and India. Yet, while cash transfers in general have a strong evidence base, a full basic income has never been implemented or rigorously evaluated. This study proposes to fill these evidence gaps with an ambitious long-term randomized control trial in Kenya.

The core objective is to test the hypothesis that a universal basic income is an effective way to eliminate extreme global poverty. This is a central policy question currently being debated in a number of emerging markets, and is also highly relevant for foreign aid policy given that the global poverty gap has fallen to $80B a year as of 2015, less than half of official development assistance flows. Positive results could shift public spending away from in-kind and means-tested programs, while negative ones could have the opposite effect. As a secondary goal, the study also aims to inform debate on the role of UBI in wealthy countries. While the populations are obviously different from those we will work with in East Africa, many of the core questions about human behavior are the same – does economic security motivate people to work more or less? To socialize more or less? etc. At a minimum, positive results from a low-cost emerging-market evaluation could be motivator for testing more expensive guarantees in richer countries.

Finally, it is worth emphasizing that in the process of producing this evidence the project will also directly benefit some of the poorest people on the planet by delivering cash transfers to them. The broader evidence base on cash transfers suggests that these recipients will reap life-changing benefits from participating in the project.

",,,2017-11-01,2029-12-31,"This projects studies the impacts of a universal basic income on Kenyan households. It aims to test across three different interventions: a short term two year universal basic income, a long term twelve year universal basic income and a lump sum cash transfer. These interventions will be conducted by GiveDirectly (the cash transfers are implemented over mobile money) but the study will be independently run by Innovations for Poverty Action Kenya. 

The cash transfers will be implemented uniformly across the relevant treatment villages. However, GiveDirectly will also implement two different nudges that will be randomized at the household level: a savings nudge and a planning nudge (as described in more detail below).
","The main outcomes of interest are economic status (income, consumption, assets, and food security), anthropometrics (for children in the household between 2-12 years of age), time use (work, education, leisure, community involvement), risk-taking (especially, migrating and starting businesses), gender relations (especially female empowerment), aspirations and mental health.",,,,"There are three different treatments arms planned for the cash transfers:

1. Long-term (twelve years) payments sized to be sufficient for basic needs ($0.75 nominal per adult per day), (given out monthly): 44 villages

2. Short-term (two years) payments sized to be sufficient for basic needs (($0.75 nominal per adult per day), (given out monthly): 80 villages

3. Lump sum payments sized with net present value equivalent to the short term payments arm (~$500 per adult), given in 2-3 lump sum payments: 71 villages

There would be a additional control group, that does not receive cash payments, covering 100 villages. In total, there will be 295 villages in the trial, from two different counties in Kenya, Siaya and Bomet.

Randomization for the cash transfers will be conducted at the village level, stratified by location - where location is an administrative unit of land in Kenya which is coarser than the village demarcation and finer than the county demarcation.

All full-time adult residents (i.e. above 18 years of age) of the village will receive cash transfers according to their treatment designation. In addition, in the long term arm, individuals above the age of 15 but under 18 will all start receiving the cash transfers three years into the study.

The study sample will consist of 30 randomly selected households from each of the 295 villages in the sample. In addition, there will a household-level randomization of nudges. A third of households in each treatment village will be given a savings nudge about M-Shwari and M-Akiba and the ability to save in a safe and secure place at the relevant interest rates for each product. A third of households will be given a planning nudge that encourages them to make plans of what they will do with the cash transfers. The remaining third of households will not receive any nudge. This randomization will be stratified so that among the 30 households sampled in each treatment village exactly 10 households will receive each nudge. The control villages will not receive any nudges.

GiveDirectly will enrol participants and implement the cash transfers. The transfers will all be delivered digitally through mobile money. They will also deliver the nudges at the time they are enrolling the cash transfer recipients in the treatment villages. 

The study is being conducted by Innovations for Poverty Action Kenya (IPAK). IPAK completed a census of study villages between 21st April and 27th June 2017. The baseline household survey started on 8th June 2017 and was completed on the 13th September 2017. In addition, a section of the baseline survey that focuses on women's empowerment was repeated with the spouse of the household head by phone once the baseline has been completed. At the same time as the baseline, IPAK is conducted a village elder survey and a market survey (the sample of markets was drawn from the set of local markets provided during village censusing activites). All survey questionnaires are enclosed as additional documentation for the trial. 

Enrollment of transfer recipients by GiveDirectly is began in November 2017 and is expected to be completed in April 2018.
",,All randomization for the project was completed using statistical software. Village-level treatment randomization was conucted using R and the within-village nudge randomization was completed in Stata.,"There are two units of randomization. The cash transfers will be randomized at the village level. The nudges will be randomized within treatment villages at the household level.
","295 villages are in the trial in total. In each village, the study will track 30 households. 

In addition, at baseline we will conduct a village elder survey in all 295 villages and market surveys across these villages in the 105 local markets where study participants buy the majority of their goods.
","There will be approximately 8,850 households surveyed as part of the study (inc. treatment and control households). However, there will be approximately 9,600 households, or 22,00 individuals, receiving some payment from the study (inc. all three treatment groups).

",,,,2016-09-01,2016-12-15,"Programs included in the study are:

1. Agricultural extension: we hired a team of 11 agriculture experts, with a combined experience of 66 years in the agricultural sector, to deliver in-person group training to randomly selected farming households. The training sessions ran from September to October 2016 - leading up to the “short rains” agricultural seasons in Kenya. The training includes education on: land preparation, planting, soil fertility, crop selection, soil and water management, field management (fertilization, pest and disease management, weeding), record keeping and financial management, farmer group dynamics and con conflict resolution, harvesting, post-harvest management, value addition and marketing.

2. Agricultural inputs: based on the advice of agricultural experts, we provided recipients with enough inputs to plant approximately 0.5 acres of cabbages or maize. The type of inputs to be provided were recommended by our agricultural consultants who determined the requirements based on terrain and crops grown in the study areas. Specifically, for the cabbage-growing region of Mbooni, we provided 50 grams of Baraka F1 seeds and 75 kilograms of planting fertilizer. For the maize-growing region of Kilungu, we provided 4 kg of Duma 43 seeds, 25 kg of planting fertilizer and 25 kg of top-dressing fertilizer. These inputs are roughly modeled after the Government of Kenya's National Accelerated Agriculture Inputs Access Program. The program includes a voucher, valued at USD 60 - 80, to cover the cost of 10 kg of hybrid maize seed, 50 kg of basal fertilizer, and 50 kg of top-dressing fertilizer, inputs sufficient for approximately 1 acre (0.4 ha) of maize. This study provides similar, though not precisely the same, package. Our agricultural inputs package also included a one-time information session on proper input usage provided by our extension agents.

3. Livestock transfers: recipients received 25 one-month old chicks vaccinated for common diseases as well as a starter pack of feed (~10 kg). Recipients were also provided with basic information about taking care of their chicks by our team of agricultural experts and were visited occasionally by the agriculture team over the following 4 months. 

4. Cash transfers: some households were randomly selected to receive direct cash transfers. The size of these transfers match the per-recipient cost of one of the above programs $15 for agricultural extension, $75 for the 319 agricultural input recipients in Mbooni and $35 for the 181 agricultural input recipients in Kilungu, and $120 for livestock transfers.

Randomization is conducted at the individual level.

In equilibrium, were recipients to be given a choice between programs and cash transfers, we expect some would choose the program, thus having a mix of those receiving cash and the program in the same village provides the most relevant comparison. Further, we chose a valuation based approach to estimating whether a respondent prefers cash or the program, as opposed to a direct choice between the two. This choice was made as a valuation approach could potentially be extended to multiple interventions of various costs (if preferences matter, it may be wise to provide the program with the highest ratio of valuation to cost).

Villages will be randomly assigned to either receive the standard Community Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) program or an integrated CLTS+Nutrition intervention. Outcomes of interest include household-level observations of: 1) sanitation practices, including toilet use, handwashing, courtyard cleanliness, child diarrhoea and correct disposal of child faeces; and 2) nutrition practices, including proper breastfeeding, and visits to health facilities. ",,,,2016-08-01,2017-04-01,"The Sannut (Sanitation-Nutrition) intervention is a modified form of the Kenya National Protocol for Community Led Total Sanitation (CLTS). The intervention clarifies with the community the link between open defecation and child malnutrition through (1) the addition of two interactive meetings that sensitize caregivers on proper toddler hygiene and nutrition, and (2) household visits that reinforce these messages. The evaluation is testing the hypothesis of whether additional focus on toddler hygiene and nutrition with community level messaging leads to change in caregiver behaviours/practices that will ultimately reduce the risk of a child becoming malnourished during their first 1000 days. 
CLTS activities, which are occurring in both treatment and control villages, consist of the following steps:
1.	Pre-trigger involving community mobilization
2.	Trigger involving a community meeting where the community is taken through their open defecation practices with the aim of eliciting shame and disgust as part of the realization that members of the community are ingesting each other’s feces. This is intended to compel community members to build and use hand washing stations and latrines.  
3.	Household follow-ups by designated community members to ensure that each household is adhering to the agreed upon commitments
4.	The community claims to have stopped open defecation
5.	External evaluators verify that the community is indeed not openly defecating
6.	The community is then certified Open Defecation Free (ODF) if the above is confirmed and a celebration is held to laud this status.

Governments are investing in expensive sewerage systems to bring sanitation services to the household door. The cost-effectiveness of these investments depends on the number of households that connect the sanitation systems. However, there are large fixed costs to connect to sewage systems including both the costs charged by the utility investment in household sanitation facilities and pipes to connect from the house to the network. We propose to use an RCT to estimate price elasticity of the demand for connections and the extent to which price elasticities depend on information about the relationship between sanitation and health. We also consider complications related to collective action multi-household compound connections and resident versus non-resident landlords. Results from this study are critical to developing pricing/subsidy and information campaign policies to cost-effectively improve connectivity.

",,,2015-01-08,2017-01-08,,"The experiment seeks to answer the following research questions:
•	What is the overall price elasticity of the demand for sewerage connections?
•	How does the price elasticity of demand change with better knowledge of the role of sanitation and preventing illness?
•	How does the price elasticity differ as the number of residents in the compound grows?
•	Is the price elasticity different when the landlord is resident versus non-resident?  
•	How much of the cost of connection is passed onto tenants and how does connection to the sewage systems affect housing rental prices?",,,,"In June 2014, a census listing of 2,200 compounds will be done to form the sampling framework and randomization for the 2,200 households.  The census will collect basic demographic information; number of households per compound; number of children; if landlord is resident or not; contact details of landlord; toilet type; etc. From this listing, two households per compound will be randomly selected for baseline. 
A baseline survey will be administered to all 2,200 compound landlords to collect socio-economic information, wealth, credit history, ownership and value of the compound, rents and policy for late payment, knowledge and attitudes towards hygiene and health, and interaction with and knowledge of tenants.
A baseline survey will be conducted with two household heads (male or female) per compound, resulting in about 4,400 household surveys.  Baseline surveys will collect data on socio-economic characteristics; sanitation facilities, use, practices, and satisfaction; water sources, use, storage, treatment, and cost; hygiene and hand-washing knowledge and practice; altruism, reciprocity, and risk preferences; and limited health outcomes such as diarrhea and child weight for height to be able to assess power for the possible health impact follow-on study.  
When available, administrative data will be used to cross-check information on take-up rates. Administrative data will also be collected and used to measure costs of the interventions. Direct costs include the subsidies, the administrative costs to deliver them, and the cost of the information campaign. We will use these costs to measure the cost-effectiveness of alternative subsidy and promotion campaigns in terms of take-up.
We will also conduct a short follow-up survey approximately 6 months after the intervention to verify the proper installation and use of sanitation facilities, satisfaction with the new sanitation facilities, other investments in housing that might have been made, changes in rent, and changes in tenants.
We will study two interventions deigned to promote take-up of household connections to the sewage system:
1.	Three subsidy amounts – a low subsidy, a medium subsidy, and a large subsidy. The low subsidy amount is the subsidy being offered by GPOBA. The medium and high subsidy amounts will be decided based on the results of formative research on willingness to pay for sanitation services, which will be conducted as part of this study. The subsidies will be delivered in the form of vouchers that will be difficult to sell in a secondary market.  The operational aspects of the voucher program will be designed and implemented by a local NGO with oversight from the research team. 
2.	An information campaign that promotes hygienic practices such as sanitation facility use, hand washing, and drinking water. The promotion campaign is being designed and delivered by the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) in the World Bank and will explicitly incorporate learning from previous WSP activities including a recent series of impact evaluations exploring the effectiveness of these campaigns.

The demand for sanitation services is also likely to be confounded with collective action problems. Moral hazard and free riding problems typically arise when the sanitation infrastructure is shared.  In many urban slums, multiple households live in compounds that share a single connection to the sewage network. Landlords may be unwilling to pay the cost of connection if they cannot recoup all or some of the cost from tenants either through increased rent or cost sharing. The per-household cost sharing needed to cover costs will be smaller in larger compounds.  Hence, larger compounds might require a smaller subsidy in order to induce the landlord to connect. In this case, a policy that has smaller subsidies for larger compounds would achieve higher connection rates than uniform subsidies for the same total budget for subsidies. On the other hand, larger compounds may lead to more free riders so that some tenants may refuse to participate in the payments and thereby freeze collective action to pay for the connection. In this case, a policy that had larger subsidies for larger compounds would achieve higher connection rates than uniform subsidies for the same total budget for subsidies. 
We also propose to measure how the cost is shared between tenant and landlord, and whether the connection results in increased rent that the landlord might be able to get from the market for the improved housing.  If the sewage connection allows landlords to raise rent to tenants and current tenants are not willing to pay the increased rent, then they may be forced to move, thereby further disadvantaging the poor. We will also assess the extent to which altruism and reciprocity traits on the part of both landlord and the tenants affect the distribution of costs, and the extent to which the landlord living in the compound affects the distribution of the costs. Altruistic landlords may not pass on much of the cost, where reciprocal landlords will likely pass them on. If most or all of the costs are passed onto tenants and rents raised, then rather than subsidizing the landlord, it might be better to subsidize tenants’ cost-sharing conditional on being able to maintain residency in newly connected compounds.  
There also may be differences in willingness to pay when the landlord is resident versus absentee.  Absentee landlords might benefit from increased rent that they could charge by connecting their property to the sewage network, and resident landlords should additionally benefit from the health value of having sanitation in their homes. Moreover, an absentee landlord is probably less likely to be able to solve the collective action problem to be able to pass on the costs to the tenants.  If the demand for sanitation is substantially different, pricing policies might have to be different not only depending on the size of housing compounds but also based on whether the landlord is resident.  ",,"The identification strategy is to generate exogenous variation through random assignment of the two interventions.  The study site consists of 2,200 compounds that each have between 6-10 dwellings. The connection to the sewage system is at the compound level. Given the density of the slum, there may be spillovers in both the information campaign and knowledge of subsidies that may affect take-up and health outcomes in a follow-up study. In order to minimize potential contamination we will group the compounds into neighborhood clusters called blocks (about 10 compounds each). The unit of intervention will be the compound and we have 220 blocks.
The evaluation design consists of randomly assigning blocks into the two interventions, creating five treatment groups and one pure control group. There will be 3 different levels of subsidies—low, medium and high—randomly offered to landlords.  The different levels of subsidies will be accompanied with a hygiene promotion campaign.  Specifically, the blocks will be randomly assigned into arms of the study. This process will be done in the office by a computer
Since treatment assignment will be random we assume treatment and control groups will be balanced and comparable.  Thus, the causal impact of the intervention will be estimated by using differences in mean outcomes between treatment and control groups.  We will also estimate a series of models that condition on landlord and tenant characteristics to attempt to reduce residual variation and increase statistical power.
For sample size calculations we use latrine connection rates as our main indicator of interest for take-up. At baseline none of the households are connected to the sewage system.  Assuming intra-cluster correlation of 0.01, a significance level of 0.05, and 0.80 power, we can detect .05 differences between each of the arms of the study. The landlord and up to two households in the compound will be surveyed.
We expect the demand for sanitation to be price elastic. One reason for such high price elasticity might be that households do not sufficiently value proper sanitation because they don’t understand the relationship between proper sanitation and health outcomes. In fact, there is evidence that awareness of potential benefits from a product may interact with the associated demand curve (Ashraf et al., 2013), as well as the identified importance of appropriate hygienic behavior (Luby et al., 2013), and water quality in influencing health outcomes (Kremer et al., 2010).
This hypothesis will be tested by examining whether an information and promotion campaign raises the demand for sanitation at each subsidy level. In this case, subsidies combined with an information campaign would best encourage take-up. However, another reason for low take-up could be that households value sanitation but have hyperbolic discount rates causing them to procrastinate. In this case, even though they know sanitation is good for them, people may put off the investment because they believe that they will have time to do so later since the benefits only accrue to them later.  In this case, the information campaign will add little. ",compound/landlord,"2200 Compounds/Landlords

To promote the use of improved sanitation in rural and low-income settings, plastic latrine slabs provide a simple option for upgrading traditional pit latrines. The International Finance Corporation/World Bank Selling Sanitation program estimated that plastic slabs would have a 34% annual growth, with a market size of US$2.53 million in Kenya by 2017. In this study, we examined the commercial viability of these plastic latrine slabs in rural Kenya by evaluating a financing and distribution model intervention, documenting household slab sales to date, and assessing consumer exposure and perceptions. We also determined household willingness to pay through a real-money auction with 322 households. We found that no households in our study area had purchased the plastic slabs. The primary barriers to slab sales were limited marketing activities and low demand compared with the sales price: households were willing to pay an average of US$5 compared with a market price of US$16. Therefore, current household demand for the plastic latrine slabs in rural Kenya is too low to support commercial distribution. Further efforts are required to align the price of plastic latrine slabs with consumer demand in this setting, such as additional demand creation, product financing, and public sector investment.

We estimate demand for two different products exhibiting differences in basis risk (i.e. mismatch between WII payouts and actual losses) and test an innovative “experiential” approach to teach producers about basis risk and WII as a risk management tool. Our novel extension approach consists of an insurance game based on the one developed by Cai and Song (2017) and modified for weather index insurance, clearly illustrating basis risk to participants.

Unlike many agricultural innovations, learning about insurance products and other risk reducing technologies can take a long time. If shocks that result in payouts are infrequent, individuals who purchase insurance may not see that it pays out in bad years until a bad year occurs. Further- more, for risks that are highly covariate, such as drought, one might not be able to readily learn from their peers. Thus, providing the opportunity for farmers to rapidly experience different out- comes with and without insurance could be an effective way to educate and increase demand (Cai and Song, 2017). Learning about index insurance (as opposed to indemnity insurance) is further complicated because there is a wider range of outcomes. With indemnity insurance, a farmer will be compensated an amount corresponding to their loss.

An aggregator working in Tharaka South sub-county of Tharaka Nithi county currently sup- plies farmers (“program farmers”) with a bundle of inputs to grow sorghum and/or green gram with deferred payment. Included in the input package is mandatory WII for the value of inputs. This “status quo” insurance contract was developed by Acre Africa using ARC2 data in 2013. In our study, 457 program farmers and 30 additional farmers are given the chance to buy additional insurance. More specifically, all farmers in our study will have the option to buy top-up WII for the value of sorghum and/or green gram production. Green gram insurance is only offered to farmers who indicate that they will not be planting sorghum during the upcoming season. For program farmers, WII is purchased in addition to mandatory input insurance. This top-up WII product was developed by Acre Africa specifically for this study using the CHIRPS dataset (Funk et al., 2015).

During the experiment, demand for two unique insurance products will be compared. These products differ in the amount of basis risk they present, holding all else constant. CHIRPS data can be downloaded at a resolution of 5x5 km; the true product uses this level of resolution for the index area. We call this high resolution (HR) index insurance. A second product developed by Acre Africa averages the high resolution CHIRPS data to create a broader index area (10x10 km). We call this low resolution (LR) index insurance.

We employ a 2x2 randomized control trial in which farmers are randomly assigned a contract type (HR or LR), and are randomly exposed to either a basic information treatment or the basic treatment plus the insurance game. There are two versions of the game, one calibrated for each insurance product. The primary outcome of interest is demand for WII, which we measure in two ways: (1) willingness to pay (WTP) across a variety of prices elicited using a multiple price list auction (Anderson et al., 2007), which is a modified version of a Becker-DeGroot-Marschack (BDM) auction (Becker, DeGroot, and Marschak, 1964), and (2) actual purchases at the offered price. We also test farmer understanding of and attitude towards weather index insurance and basis risk at the time insurance is offered. Following treatment, all farmers will have the opportunity to purchase the HR insurance product, and receive randomized discounts through the auction to do so.

We make two primary contributions. First, we examine whether farmers are sensitive to basis risk by comparing demand for two insurance products that differ only by resolution. Basis risk is considered to be one of the greatest barriers to index insurance adoption (Carter et al., 2014), yet relatively little is known about how sensitive farmer demand is to it.3 We believe this is an important question given continual efforts to improve the resolution of index insurance products. If such improvements do not increase farmer demand it would suggest that commercially-viable improvements in basis risk might not induce higher uptake of WII on their own. Previous studies have used distance from weather stations as a proxy for basis risk, and in some cases found that demand is quite sensitive it, particularly when the price is high (Hill, Hoddinott, and Kumar, 2013). However, it is possible that distance from weather stations is correlated with unobservables that affect demand. Our design offers a transparent way to measure sensitivity to basis risk, albeit at only two different levels.

Our second contribution is to evaluate the use of insurance games as an extension tool in the promotion of WII, and in particular, to help farmers understand basis risk. We will analyze how a game focused on basis risk alters demand for insurance, and how individual or peer experiences in the game affect demand for insurance. Games have been used to study insurance demand in other contexts, including projects in Kenya (Janzen and Carter, 2013), Ethiopia (Norton et al., 2014), and Peru (Boucher and Mullally, 2010). Elabed and Carter (2015) use a compound lottery to estimate the effect of basis risk on insurance demand, but in the hypothetical. Cai and Song (2017) found that playing insurance games in China led to a 48% increase in yield insurance uptake (an increase of 9 percentage points), and that random shocks experienced within the games also increased insurance demand. Like Cai and Song (2017), we incorporate games into extension rather than using them solely as a research tool. Our games differ from Cai and Song (2017) in several important ways. First, our games are incentive compatible (payouts are based on game results) in an attempt to increase salience. Second, our games simulate WII, as opposed to standard indemnity insurance, and highlight the role of basis risk.

Weather index insurance is often touted as an alternative risk management tool. Demand for weather index insurance, however, has been weak. One possible reason is basis risk, the mismatch between index insurance payouts and individual outcomes. We estimate the impact of two interventions on preferred coverage under a real index insurance product, as revealed through an auction: (1) a reduction in basis risk, and (2) an experiential game that teaches farmers how index insurance works, with an emphasis on basis risk. We show all farmers demonstrate strong sensitivity to basis risk. The experiential game modestly increased knowledge, and experiential game participants indicate higher levels of preferred insurance coverage. While offering a lower basis risk insurance product and playing an experiential game both increase preferred coverage in isolation, there is no additional impact of doing both. We adapt a theoretical model of misattribution bias to demonstrate how reference-dependent learning with loss aversion could lead to this unexpected result.

Other loans—especially in developing countries —instead require using existing assets as collateral. We hypothesize that the endowment effect (Kahneman et al. 1990) causes consumers to dislike placing existing assets at risk by promising them as collateral. This might drive down take-up of loans collateralized using existing assets, relative to collateralizing with new assets (which may not yet have entered the reference point). The proposed project will test this mechanism using a randomized experiment in Kenya. A secondary goal will be to test whether borrowers anticipate that new assets might themselves eventually enter the reference point, becoming subject to an endowment effect. Our findings will shed light on psychological factors affecting demand for financing, and on the welfare implications of loans collateralized using new assets.",,,,2017-09-25,2018-09-25,"We endow households with one randomly-selected household or agricultural durable good, and offer them a loan to purchase a second randomly-selected good. We elicit willingness to pay for two types of loans to purchase the second good: standard asset-collateralized loans (SACLs) and new asset-collateralized loans (NACLs). SACLs require borrowers to use existing assets as collateral, while NACLs use the very item being purchased as collateral. These loans are administered by a well-established Kenyan Savings and Credit Cooperative Organization (SACCO).","Primary outcome:

Perceived risk of loan default
Willingness to accept for previously endowed items
Predicted future willingness to accept for items to be endowed
Acceptance or rejection of small-scale, gain-loss lotteries (to measure loss aversion).
",,,,"We will endow each respondent with an item for free, and later elicit their willingness to pay for new items using a loan, experimentally varying whether the previously endowed item or the new item being purchase is used as collateral. We will elicit predictions of future willingness to pay for these loans, to determine whether respondents anticipate their loan preferences prior to being endowed with any item. ","In a first session, we will elicit participants’ willingness to pay for a list of agricultural and household items using the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) method. For each respondent, we will identify three of these items that they value similarly. Out of these three, one item will be randomly selected to be given to the respondent for free. Then, after several days, the respondent will return for a second session. In this session, we will elicit willingness to pay (again using BDM) for the remaining two items using a loan. One of the items will be paid for using a SACL, with the item endowed in the first session as collateral, while the other item will be paid for using a NACL, with the new item being purchased itself as collateral. Random assignment of which item is initially endowed, which is for sale using a SACL, and which is for sale using a NACL ensures that the average willingness to pay for the assets being purchased and used as collateral is the same in the SACL and the NACL, such that any systematic difference between willingness to pay for the two loans can be attributed to the endowment effect.

In the first session, before respondents are endowed with any item, we elicit predictions of future willingness to pay for items using a SACL and a NACL. This allows us to determine whether respondents who are subject to an endowment effect are sophisticated about how such an effect will influence their future loan take-up decisions. However, this survey module will only be completed by a randomly selected subset of all respondents. Randomizing whether respondents are asked to make these predictions will allow us to measure the extent to which having to predict future decisions influences actual future decisions. If the loan prediction module does influence responses in the later loan take-up module, having a group of respondents who did not make these predictions allows us to measure loan demand without such a prediction effect. For a randomly selected half of the respondents who participate in this module, we will offer a small incentive for accurate predictions.

Additionally, to estimate the magnitude of the endowment effect over the initially endowed item, we will elicit willingness to accept for the endowed item during the second session, after respondents have owned the item for several days. A difference between willingness to pay for the item in the first session and willingness to accept for the item in the second session indicates that the respondent experiences an endowment effect over the item. Again, we measure sophistication over such an effect by eliciting predictions in the first session, before the item is endowed, of future willingness to accept in the second session. Again, these predictions will be incentivized for a randomly selected half of respondents, as in the loan willingness to pay predictions.

Finally, we measure individual-level loss aversion, which may drive the endowment effect, by asking respondent to accept or reject a series of six small-stakes gain-loss lotteries with varying (positive) expected value. We then select one of the six lotteries at random, and implement that lottery if the respondent previously chose to accept it.

However, agricultural productivity is low and diminishing; production declined by 5% and 2.3% in 2008 and 2009, respectively (World Bank 2009). While productivity enhancement and poverty reduction is a multifaceted challenge, adoption of modern technology especially in agriculture can play important role in poverty reduction. Successful technology adoption, however, appears to be constrained by a lack of access to information, and know-how, among others. Providing information and training on modern inputs and cropping practices and encouraging farmers to set goals can go a long way to adopt modern agricultural technology. 

EA-MDA, in partnership with the Banana Growers Association of Kenya (BGAK), is taking concrete steps to solve the problems faced by small holder banana farmers. In Kenya, banana is consumed both as a fruit as well as cooked food, and it is an importance source of carbohydrates, essential vitamins and minerals. There are approximately 270,000 smallholder banana farmers in Kenya, and about half of them are women. To enhance the capacity of the farmers and FOs, EA-MDA will train farmers and FOs on aspects such as land preparation, planting and variety selection, weed control, harvesting, grading and post-harvest handling and record keeping.
The proposed study attempts to evaluate the effectiveness of EA-MDA’s interventions using a randomized control trial. The study will find the extent to which the interventions increase the rate of adoption of new technologies, productivity, and ultimately, farmers’ income. There is also growing evidence on various behavioural constraints in technology adoption and fostering income. Drawing on lessons from behavioural literature, we will also test the extent to which a nudge for goal setting may affect technology adoption will also be tested. This particular aspect is designed not only for assessing the underlying behavioural constraints in technology adoption but also for improving the program of our implementation partner.  

In addition, the study will measure spill-over effects and social learning, which are often important policy parameters in themselves. 
The proposed study will inform policy makers on how farmers and farmer organizations can learn to manage their operations and adopt modern technologies. The results of this study will fill an important gap in terms of information to feed into agricultural development and poverty reduction policy in Kenya and other developing countries.

",,,2016-11-01,2018-05-01,"The program “Building a competitive banana industry in Kenya” that we evaluate is developed by East Africa Market Development Associates (EA-MDA) with financial support from the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA). The program is attempting to tackle four interrelated problems:
Problem 1, Production: Farmers and Farmer Organizations (FOs) do not know how to produce modern variety and high quality banana for high-end retail stores such as Nakumatt and Naivas.  
Problem 2, Post-harvest handling: Smallholder farmers lack knowledge on post-harvest handling of banana thereby causing significant waste and spoilage when bananas are being moved from farms to markets. 
Problem 3, Marketing: Smallholder farmers currently lack access to high-value markets and cannot sell their bananas to intermediaries (consolidators) who procure for such markets. 
Problem 4, Behavioural constraints in translating goals into actions: This is an add-on component that we intend to pilot to strengthen the core model of EA-MDA. Training on new technology may fail to increase adoptions due to various obstacles (such as failing to get started, becoming distracted) that cause friction from goals to actions. There are strong evidences in psychology literature on potential strong effects of simple plans. We intend to develop an intervention on goal setting that will involve working with the farmers to set individualized implementation plans, setting a course of actions and a simple reminder. 
To address these problems, EA-MDA is offering information, training and marketing links. The training will provide farmers with necessary agronomic practices and expertise on the handling of planting materials from nursery to the fields and the care required in the initial phase of production to get the right quality. It will also provide training on post-harvest technologies so that farmers acquire the technical expertise to ensure that products are properly sorted and graded, and there are no losses when banana is harvested. In addition, EA-MDA will work with intermediaries who procure for large supermarket chains so that farmers can sell their high-quality banana to them and receive a price premium. Finally, it will also work with FOs to build their technical and institutional capacity for sustainability and scaling up.  
In order to evaluate their impacts, EA-MDA will work with some FOs/villages while others will act as comparison groups. In FOs/villages that will have interventions, two sets of interventions are considered: all members of the farmer groups will be provide with information, training and marketing links, while half of the training participants will be trained on goal setting. Intended beneficiaries of EA-MDA’s interventions are smallholder farmers, their FOs, as well intermediaries involved in agricultural value chain. Special considerations will be provided to female smallholder farmers who historically have had lower access to information, training and other services than their male counterparts. EA-MDA expects that due to its interventions, farmers will adopt modern technologies and farming practices; input suppliers will supply modern inputs and technologies; and procurers will purchase output from them.  
","In this evaluation, we will use groups of outcome indicators related to technology adoption, yield and income. The specific outcome indicators to be used for the study are listed below 
•	Banana cultivation (outcome class 1)
-	Dummy variable if a farmer has used any land for banana cultivation
-	Number of plots used for banana cultivation 
-	Total amount of land used for banana cultivation

•	Technology adoption (outcome class 2)
-	Dummy variable equal to one if the farmer has cultivated any of the modern varieties (FIA, Giant, Cavendish, Uganda Green, Williams, Grand Nine or Valery); and zero if not cultivated (including those who did not do any banana cultivation).
-	Dummy variable if used banana plantlet that is purchased (as a validation of whether actually used TC)
-	Dummy variables if the farmer used Tissue Culture (TC) plantlets 
-	Number of plots used for modern varieties (specified earlier in this outcome class) of banana cultivation
-	Total amount of land used for modern varieties of banana cultivation (by aggregating the size of the plots that are used mainly for banana cultivation, and banana varieties include modern ones)

•	Farming practices for banana cultivation (outcome class 3) 
-	Dummy variable if the farmers have done weeding 
-	Dummy variable if the farmers have hired labour for weeding 
-	Dummy variable if the farmers have used any fertilizer or manure
-	Dummy variable if the farmers have used any chemical fertilizer
-	Dummy variable if the farmers have used pesticides
-	An index of improve farming practices from the above indicators
-	Amount of money spent for plantlets, hiring labour, fertilizer and pesticides for banana cultivation.

•	Banana production (outcome class 4)
-	Total amount of banana produced in the last season. The local measures of production will be converted to kg. 
-	Banana yield (in kg) per acre 
-	Value of total banana production. (Unit price of sales will be used for the farmers who sold any banana. For the farmers who did not sell any banana, median price for the village will be used for imputing value)

•	Sales (outcome class 5)
-	Total amount (in kg) of banana sold 
-	Total revenue from banana sales
-	Dummy variable if sold through EAMDA supported marketing agents
-	Dummy variable if have a written contract for the banana sales

•	Household income (outcome class 6)
-	Net income from banana production - by deducting the direct expenses for banana cultivation from the value of production. This variable will not include opportunity cost of own labour. 
-	Total household income (including banana, other crops, livestock, non-farm business and wage employment). Data from section 12 will be used for this total income calculation, and remittance and pension income will be included in this total income. 
-	Cash savings, household assets, outstanding debt
",,"In addition to these 6 outcome classes, we will look into several set of indicators to explore possible mechanisms of change and for spillover effects
-	Assess the outcome class 3 for other major crops as spillover effects on general farming practices. 
-	General farming practices on using hybrid seeds, fertilizer and irrigation in the last one year. These are variables from Section 7 of the questionnaire, and are not asked for specific crops.
-	Total outstanding loans and use of borrowed money for covering cost of banana cultivation 

For the endline, the study is also collecting data on three additional modules as secondary outcomes. These are
- Locus of control (10 item LOC module)
- Time preference (preference from hypothetical payment options with different interest rates at present vs. 3 months/4 months/15 months in future)
- Risk preference (preference from 6 options of increasing risk and expected pay-offs)
",,"The study adopts a randomized control design that involve both village and household level randomization. The study targeted 90 villages as study sites that were identified by the EAMDA for possible intervention. We aimed to survey 50 households per village at baseline with a total sample of 4,500 farmer households. At the first stage of randomization, villages were randomly assigned to five groups to vary the intensity of interventions. The 30 villages that are assigned to ‘pure control’ group will not have any intervention from EAMDA during the evaluation period. 

In the other four types of villages, 15 villages in each type, the number of intervention households are 10, 20, 30 and 40 respectively. In these villages, the treatment households are randomly selected from the baseline survey, and the list is provided to the implementation teams to invite at the training sessions. The control households in these intervention villages are our “spillover sample”. Finally, half of the households from the treatment group were randomly selected for receiving the goal setting intervention. Therefore, we have five types of villages and four types of households in the study. While the village types vary in the number of treatment households, the household types are
Group 1: Control group (E1 in the figure above) 
Group 2: Spillover group (A2, B2, C2 and D2)
Group 3: Treatment households (A1, B1, C1 and D1)
Group 4: Goal setting households (A2G, B2G, C2G and D2G, which is a sub-sample of Group 3)
",,Randomization done in office by a computer,Both village level (whether to provide training) and individual level (for spillover and goal setting exercise) randomization,90 villages,"We expected to interview 4,500 households from 90 villages. On average, 53 households were interviewed per village with a total sample of 4,719 households during baseline.","60 villages in treatment groups, 30 villages in control group. The 60 villages are further randomized into four groups (15 villages in each) for intensity of interventions (10, 20, 30 and 40 households). These treatment households are randomly selected from the eligible households (53 on average per village)","There are two levels of power calculation. Firstly, using village level randomization, we estimate the direct effects (on treatment households in treatment villages) and spillover effects (on control households in treatment village) against the control villages. Using 90 clusters, of which 2/3 treatment, with 18 households per cluster, the standardized MDE is 0.2 (at 80% power, 5% level of significance and 0.1 ICC). This 0.2 is a conservative estimate as it does not account for the larger number of households in control villages and baseline correlation of the outcomes. Secondly, at the individual level randomization (i.e. comparing treatment and control households in treatment villages), the MDE is much lower. For example, with 2700 households from the treatment villages (assuming 10% attrition from the intended 50 HH per cluster) divided into a treatment and control, the MDE for binary outcomes is 0.03 if the control group proportion is 0.1 (e.g. TCB use) to 0.054 if the control group proportion is 0.5 (e.g. fertilizer use for banana). For the goal setting component, which is randomized at household level, these MDEs are 0.046 and 0.076 respectively (with 1350 HHs in treatment and control groups).

The simplest model that explains these findings is one in which stress increases the discount rate or present bias. A sharp test of this model is provided by intertemporal choices in the losses or effort domain: this model predicts that stress should lead to increased choice of larger, later losses or effortful tasks relative to smaller, earlier ones. Here we show suggestive evidence for the opposite result: using a laboratory experiment with 578 participants from informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya, we find that stress increases choices of smaller, sooner outcomes across domains. Specifically, we show that the effect is present in monetary gains and losses, and effortful tasks; and for both a psychosocial stressor (Trier Social Stress Test), and the pharmacological elevation of stress hormone levels using hydrocortisone. Importantly, the results are statistically robust only in the absence of clustering, and should thus be regarded as tentative. However, they are at least initially consistent with a model in which stress increases discounting in the gains domain but decreases it in the losses and effort domains; or with a model in which stress decreases the utility of any future outcome. Thus, stress may affect intertemporal choice, but may do so through mechanisms other than a simple increase in discount rates or present bias.

Yet more than 200 million children under age five in low and middle income countries (LMICs) will fail to reach their developmental potential as adults, predominantly due to poverty, poor health and nutrition, and inadequate cognitive and psychosocial stimulation. Early childhood development (ECD) interventions that integrate nutrition and child stimulation activities have been proposed as a powerful policy tool for the remediation of early disadvantages in poor settings, and numerous field studies have shown they can be effective in improving children's developmental and health outcomes, at least in the short-term. Key questions remain on what models of delivery are the most effective and cost-effective that can be potentially scalable in LMICs, as well as how to sustain parental behavioral changes over time, which can lead to long-term improvements in child development and the possibility of positive spillovers to benefit younger siblings. Having a better understanding of the underlying behavioral pathways leading from intervention, to parental behavior changes, to child impacts, is also key to inform policy about the optimal design of interventions to maximize their scalability and sustainability. This study will conduct a multi-arm clustered randomized controlled trial across 60 villages and 1200 households in rural Western Kenya that tests different potentially cost-effective delivery models for an ECD intervention with a curriculum that integrates child psychosocial stimulation and nutrition education. Selected households will undergo baseline and follow-up surveys to measure short-term impacts in parental behaviors and children's developmental outcomes, and the study will collect data on potential mediators of parental behavioral change to uncover the pathways leading to impacts. Two follow-up surveys, one immediately after the end of the planned intervention and a second two years later, will enable testing of the short term and midterm sustainability of impacts, as well as the presence of any spillovers onto younger siblings. In collaboration with a local NGO, the Safe Water and AIDS Project (SWAP), community health volunteers (CHVs) will be trained to implement the intervention by introducing the ECD curriculum in their villages.

To maximize participation, prior to each session the CHVs will send an SMS reminder of the session's topic, time and location to all participants.

After the end of the 16 biweekly sessions, we will re-randomize across the 40 intervention villages, stratified by Arms 1 and 2, and half of each of Arm 1 and Arm 2 villages will receive bimonthly booster visits for the period between endline and follow-up surveys.

Arm 2 (""group+home"" sessions): Group meetings with a limited number of individual home visits and booster sessions
Intervention for Arm 2:
Behavioral: Group+Home sessions 
Households in Arm 2 will receive a total of 16 sessions with identical content similar to Arm 1, but 4 of those sessions will replace group sessions held at the level of villages for personalized home visits, in which the CHV will visit each participant household to deliver these sessions. These home visits will cover identical material and topics as the group sessions in Arm 1 villages, but will be delivered on a personalized basis in the home of the mother and child. Personal barriers to the practices will be discussed and an active resolution strategy developed in concert with the CHV.

After the end of the 16 biweekly sessions, we will re-randomize across the 40 intervention villages, stratified by Arms 1 and 2, and half of each of Arm 1 and Arm 2 villages will receive bimonthly booster visits for the period between endline and follow-up surveys.

Arm 3: No Intervention
This arm will serve as the control group to identify the effects of a parenting intervention and the most effective mode of delivery, as well as the sustained impacts from the intervention

","Changes in child development, and changes in parental behavior","The Bayley Scales of Infant Development 3rd edition (Bayley's III), is validated in African settings and provides measures for all dimensions of child development up to 42 months of age. In the baseline and follow-up surveys, the study will also use the Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool (MDAT), which can be applied to children up to 6 years old and is culturally relevant in Sub Saharan African (SSA) settings, with good reliability.

At baseline, the study will use the Family Care Indicators, a self-reported scale of parenting practices which measures the quality time spent with children in learning and playing activities for young children at home. Examples of questions are how often parents take children out to the park, or other recreational activities, whether there is always an adult looking after children, the frequency of learning and play activities with children, and the amount and variety of play and learning materials. In the first follow-up survey the study will complement the Family Care Indicators with observational measures of practices using the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) inventory, a 45 item structured survey combining mother self report and observational measures.","1.

","- Anthropometrics will be measured using techniques for the WHO Multicenter Growth Reference Study (MGRS).
- Food security will be measured using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS). This scale measures food insecurity. The questionnaire consists of nine questions that represent a generally increasing level of severity of food insecurity (access). Each HFIAS question consists of the stem (timeframe for recall), the body of the question (refers to a specific behavior or attitude), and four response options (0 to 3) that represent a range of frequencies (0 = never, 1 = rarely, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often). The HFIAS score is a continuous measure of the degree of food insecurity (access) in the household (in the past 30 days). The maximum score for a household is 27 (the household response to all 9 questions was ""often"", coded with response code of 3); the minimum score is 0. The higher the score, the more food insecurity (access) the household experienced. The lower the score, the less food insecurity (access) a household experienced.
-The study will measure perceived social support using the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), which has the advantage of measuring distinctly social support from family, friends and a significant other, which is key to analyze the differential impact of our experimental arms.
-The study will adopt measures from investigators' work in Uganda to measure ways of coping with interpersonal conflicts and daily stressors. Parental stress will be assessed using the Parenting Stress Index (PSI). The study will measure maternal psychological well-being using the widely used Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD) with proven psychometric properties
-The study will elicit maternal knowledge about child development through asking mothers about the ages at which they think the child would be able achieve certain developmental milestones, which are then compared with the expected ages reported in the literature.
-The study will adapt and measure the scale to elicit beliefs developed by Cunha et al. (2013)with the target of eliciting parental beliefs regarding the benefits of providing children better cognitive and non-cognitive stimulation. The instrument asks parents about developmental milestones in language and socio-emotional development under different home scenarios, which are constructed using data from the Family Care Indicators.","The evaluation design is a factorial assignment and consists of a clustered Randomized Control Trial (cRCT) in which 60 CHVs and their associated villages will be randomly assigned to one of three equally-sized treatment arms.

1929,Understanding Demand for Electricity Among Rural Consumers Using Pay as You Go Solar,http://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/3138,"July 27, 2018",2018-07-27 13:19:45 -0400,2018-07-25,AEARCTR-0003138,10.1257/rct.3138-1.0,Megan Lang megan.lang@berkeley.edu,on_going,2018-07-01,2019-06-30,"[""environment_and_energy"", ""welfare""]",Private,,,,"What is the willingness to pay for reliable electricty among rural consumers in developing countries, and how responsive is demand to changes in the price of electricity? Electrification is a major growth policy challenge for developing countries, as it requires large investments in infrastructure while consumers' and producers' willingness to pay for electricity in low income countries remains largely unknown. These challenges are exacerbated in rural areas, where potential consumers of electricity tend to be poorer and the costs of extending access to the grid higher than in urban markets. I use a randomized control trial (RCT) with customers of a pay as you go (PAYG) solar company in Rwanda and Kenya to study demand for electricity among rural consumers by randomly varying the effective price of electricity for different consumers. This experimental design allows me to estimate the price elasticity of demand for electricity and to trace out the demand curve for electricity. Because customers have a solar home system that includes a battery for storing electricity generated during daylight hours, consumers have reliable access to electricity as long as they purchase system access time. Therefore, my estimates of consumer demand will be estimates of demand for reliable access to electricity. Furthermore, consumers in my sample purchase all appliances except mobile phones from the solar provider, nearly all of which are primarily for consumption. These features of my experimental setting enable me to contribute to understanding demand for reliable electricity for consumption among rural consumers. 

In addition to providing evidence on the nature of demand for electricity among rural consumers, I will contribute to the growing body of evidence on the benefits of rural electrification. Measuring the benefits of electricity for consumption is particularly challenging, as it requires valuing difficult to measure benefits like increased leisure time, long-term improvements in health outcomes, improvements in educational outcomes, and enhanced feelings of safety and security (CGAP 2017). Rather than attempting to directly value such benefits, I take a novel approach by applying the techniques developed in Ligon (2016) to measure households' marginal utility of expenditure. I plan to supplement this with a structural estimate of welfare. 
",,,,2018-07-01,2018-12-31,I offer promotions to existing customers of a pay as you go (PAYG) solar company that randomly vary the effective price that the customer pays for a day of electricity. ,"Days of electricity purchased in a single month, marginal utility of expenditure.","I plan to estimate the marginal utility of expenditure using the methods in Ligon (2016). This entails eliciting household composition (number of boys, girls, men, and women living in the household) and eliciting expenditures on a range of income-elastic goods. For each good, I regress expenditures on the number of boys, girls, men, and women living in the house as well as a time by location fixed effect to account for price variation. This leaves me with a matrix of residuals, on which I perform a singular value decomposition (SVD). The marginal utility of expenditure is an object of rank one, so the SVD yields an estimate that is proportional to the marginal utility of expenditure, providing a measure of welfare for the household.","Frequency of remote lockouts, duration of remote lockouts, customer satisfaction.","I plan to ask a series of questions eliciting customer satisfaction with the company, particularly focusing on issues of fairness and value for money. I will combine these into a customer satisfaction index.","I randomly offer payment incentives to existing customers of a solar company in Rwanda and Kenya. PAYG solar customers purchase time on their solar home systems rather than kilowatt hours. Therefore, incentives take one of two forms. The first incentive is of the form ""purchase X days and receive Y days free."" The second incentive is of the form ""purchase X days over the course of a month and receive Y days free at the end of the month."" For each type of incentive, I randomly offer some customers a high discount, or a high number of free days, and others a low discount. The discounts range between 3.5-15% on the low discount schedule and 7-24% on the high discount schedule, with discounts increasing in the number of days purchased for both types of incentives. Finally, I offer some customers discounts starting at a low minimum threshold and others discounts starting at a high minimum threshold. This cross-randomized experimental design induces random variation in the effective price of electricity. Finally, I offer a simple information treatment that merely informs customers about how well they have to pay to be considered ""good customers"" by the solar company.","I am randomly offering 800 customers the bulk incentives and 800 customers the reliability incentives. Within each type of incentive, half of the customers will be randomly selected to be on a low incentive schedule and half on a high incentive schedule. Effective discounts range from 3.5-15% on the low discount schedule and from 7-24% on the high discount schedule. Finally, half of all customers within each incentive-type/incentive-level combination will be able to qualify for an incentive by purchasing at least four weeks, while the other half will only qualify upon purchasing 5 weeks. Therefore, I have eight groups of 200 customers each facing different types of incentives at a high or low incentive and at a high or low qualifying threshold. I have randomly selected an additional 800 customers to serve in the control group. I stratify all randomization by past payment performance.  I am stratifying on past payment behavior to ensure that my sample contains a sufficient number of high electricity demand customers and low electricity demand customers. 

Customers are being notified of the incentives that they face by a representative from the solar company's call center, and they also receive a SMS message with their incentive schedule for their future reference. Customers who are offered bulk incentives receive a SMS each time they make a qualifying purchase that informs them about how many bonus days they earned with their purchase. Customers who are offered reliability incentives will receive a SMS at the end of each month that informs them of how many bonus days they earned that month. Finally, customers receive a SMS notification when they come within three days of beginning to use their bonus days and when they come within three days of running out of time on their system. 

I am collecting data in three ways. For one, I have access to the universe of administrative data from the solar company which includes information on basic customer demographics, appliances owned by each customer, system maintenance and customer calls to the call center, and the complete payment history of each customer. In addition, I am sending customers in Rwanda short monthly  SMS surveys on consumption expenditures on a select set of goods, which I identified using the methods outlined in Ligon (2016). In effect, I select foods that are the most income elastic and which constitute a non-neglibile share of household expenditures among rural households in the lowest income quartile in a nationally representative survey. These SMS surveys will enable me to measure households' marginal utility of expenditures at a relatively high frequency. The other data collection I plan to do is an endline survey, which will take place with an enumerator over the phone at the end of the experiment in December, 2018 or January, 2019. This survey will provide one final measure of the marginal utility of expenditures, elicit more information about energy usage and customer satisfaction, and collect other data deemed relevant by stakeholders who I plan to engage with as I design the final survey instrument.",The randomization is done in an office by a computer.,"The randomization is done at the level of the individual customer, there is no clustering.

Note that when performing power calculations, I am presenting power calculations for 800 treated individuals (in a given type of incentive) compared to 800 control individual (the pure control combined with the information treatment). All sub-analyses will have less power in accordance with the reduced sample. ","For days purchased in a single month and the duration of remote lockouts, the relevant units are days. If I assume that the data are distributed normally with mean of 23.44 days and a standard deviation between one and a half and three days for the days purchased in a single month, this indicates that I will have a minimum detectable effect size of 0.19-0.38 standard deviations, which would be 7-14% of the mean. 

When examining the marginal utility of expenditures, the relevant unit will be utils/RWF, as I am measuring expenditures in Rwandan Francs. I have very little upon which to base my power calculations for this outcome, as it is a novel measure of welfare and I have insufficient data on the individuals in my sample to extrapolate from nationally representative surveys of Rwanda. However, using the data from Ligon (2016), I estimate that assuming my data are distributed normally with a mean MUE of 0.14 and a standard deviation of between 0.01 and 0.05, I will have a MDE of 0.001 to 0.006 standard deviations, or 8-40% of the mean.

In particular, we studied a Kenyan dairy's saving and credit cooperative which randomly offered different borrowing conditions to different members for a loan for a particular asset: a 5000 liter water tank. The cooperative's standard borrowing conditions required that one third of loans be secured with deposits by the borrower, and that the remaining two thirds be secured with cash or shares from guarantors. In this study, we compare this loan contract to less stringent loan contracts to study how these requirements affect take up and loan repayments. We also conduct a number of different surveys to study the impacts of the water tanks themselves. 
",,,,2010-03-01,2010-10-30,"The intervention is a credit intervention, in collaboration with a savings and credit cooperative (SACCO). The main intervention covered 1804 farmers who were offered a loan for a 5000 liter plastic water tank worth 24,000 Kenyan shillings (approximately $320). The loans were rolled out between March and October 2010.

The loan capital could only be used to purchase the water tank. Once the loan contracts with the SACCO was signed, the SACCO delivered the tanks to the farmer's house. The loans were to be paid over 24 months, with a month principal payment of KShs 1,000 due a month. The interest charged by the SACCO was 1% on a declining balance.   

A second phase of loans was rolled out between February and April 2012, covering 2600 farmers. This was conducted as an out of sample test of the loan contracts.
","Measures of loan default (late payments, early payments, pending default letters, default); measure of productivity of the water tanks (milk sales, milk production), assets (especially ownership of water tanks), time use (by age and gender), child education outcomes ","We conducted a number of different surveys:

- A first baseline survey was administered to 2046 households regularly selling milk to the dairy out of which 1804 farmers were administered the loans. This was collected in two rounds (one in June through November 2009 and the second in February-July 2010). The baseline survey collected data on demographics, production of milk, agricultural production, household assets, credit, income and consumption. The baseline sample was of 2046 farmers. For these farmers, we then conducted a screening test to determine if the farmers were still delivering milk to the Nyala Cooperative. The post-screening sample of 1804 farmers were then randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups as above.

- A second baseline (as an update) was administered to 917 farmers from the first phase of the first baseline (due to a delay in implementation) in March-June 2010. 

- The first follow up was conducted on a sample of 901 households that covered just two treatments groups (Groups A and C described below) in January-March 2011, covering the same questions as the original baseline.

- We administered additional production surveys and time use surveys. The production surveys were conducted on the sample from treatment groups A and C (in September 2011 and February 2012) and the time use surveys on the full sample (in September 2011, February 2012 and May 2012). 

- Administrative data from the dairy was used to construct indicators of loan recovery, repossession, early repayment and late repayment collection actions
",,,"The 1804 farmers were randomly divided into the following groups of loan contracts: 

Group A: an asset collateralized loan that required a standard small deposit of Ksh 1,000 (4%) from the borrower [510 farmers]

Group G: an asset collateralized loan that required a single guarantor to back Ksh 5,000 (21%) of the loan against default in addition to the standard small deposit of Ksh 1,000 (4%) from the borrower [425 farmers]

Group D: an asset collateralized loan that required a larger deposit of Ksh 5000 (21%) along with the standard small deposit of Ksh 1,000 (4%), all from the borrower [450 farmers]

Group C: a 100%  cash collateralized joint liability loan that required up to 3 guarantors to pledge Ksh 16,000 (2/3rd of the loan amount) against default in addition to a deposit of Ksh 8000 (1/3rd of loan amount) from the borrower [419 farmers]

In addition, the farmers in Groups D and G were further split into two sub-groups to isolate the effect of guarantors and deposit requirement on farmers. We randomly divided Group D & G into the following sub-groups, Group DM , Group DW , Group GM , and Group GW wherein M implies maintained and W implies waived.

Group GM - The terms of the loan and guarantor deposit amounts were maintained 

Group GW - After the first month installment, the guarantors were released of their responsibility for the loan in the event of default and their deposits of Ksh 5000 were returned.This implied that the farmers in this sub-group assumed full responsibility for repayment with the asset (water tank) as collateral, just as in Group A.

Group DM  -  The terms of the loans and deposit requirements were maintained.

Group DW - After the first month installment , the farmers were given back Ksh 5000 (21%) of their deposit. This left the farmers in this sub-group with the standard small deposit of Ksh 1000 (4%) just as in Group A.

All farmers in these two groups are informed of the 50% possibility of their loans being modified at the time they sign their loan agreements. 

As a result of the sub-division, all the farmers in Group A, Group DW, and Group GW have identical loan terms of having Ksh 1000 deposit, no guarantors, and being asset-collateralized. Therefore, any difference in take-up and repayment rates across the groups can be attributed to the underlying characteristics derived from the selection of the sample. Any difference in repayment in Group DM and Group DW is due to the incentive effect of having a larger deposit (Ksh 6000 vs Ksh 1000); and any difference between Group GM, and Group GW can be attributed to the incentive effects of requiring a guarantor.

",,,,2019-01-21,2020-08-31,"We propose two interventions to improve case disposition and outcomes: courtroom monitoring and case clerking.

Courtroom Monitoring: Simply watching a public proceeding may improve the quality of that proceeding. This intervention will assign one courtroom monitor to attend all portions of a randomly selected court case. At the first meeting for the case, the monitor will introduce herself to the magistrate and the advocates present. During the trial, the monitor will follow the proceeding, compiling two kinds of information. First, she will fill out an app-based questionnaire on procedural aspects of the trial like witnesses called, cross-examination, and sentencing mitigation statements. Second, she will record outcome information like length of trial, verdict, and sentence/fine.

Magistrates' case clerks: Clerks will be randomly assigned to magistrates for several months, working with the magistrate to produce judgments for cases that magistrate is working on. Case clerks reduce the administrative and research costs related to the composition of a legal judgment by providing support on the recording of evidence, legal research, and drafting of judgment language. In this implementation, clerks will be hired from the class of graduating law students and trained on judgment writing, legal research, and sentencing guidelines prior to their first case assignment.

If ""observed"", the case will be followed across its lifecycle by an observer who will collect relevant procedural and outcome data. If ""unobserved"", no observer will be present in the courtroom, but procedural and outcome data will be culled from administrative records about the case.

We additionally provide tenants with information about account balances and payment behavior to test the effect of strengthening bottom-up accountability in low and high enforcement settings. The study builds on work exploring how to effectively expand the provision of basic services (water, electricity, sewerage) to low income areas when poor households are typically unable to bear the full costs of connection and use. Subsidies and/or lines of credit have been successful in increasing household-level access, but this can increase the debt burden of utilities and households if customers fail to pay. This, in turn, threatens the sustainability and incentives of utilities to expand access further. Combining limited ability/willingness to pay with weak and ad hoc enforcement mechanisms in informal settlements, where the majority of Kenya’s urban poor live, means that defaulting on monthly fees for water and sewer charges is the norm rather than the exception.

The program, Greatness United (G-United), places Kenyan university graduates in primary schools around the country to improve student learning and boost national cohesion, but the program suffers from high levels of volunteer attrition. This evaluation aims to understand how the range of individuals’ geographic preferences can be used in civil servants’ assignments, and if incorporating these preferences can lead to better performance and increase retention. By incorporating participants’ idiosyncratic preferences into placements for a random subset of participants and schools, the evaluation will explore how such a system helps or hinders the various goals of the program, including improving learning outcomes and strengthening national unity (as measured by inter-ethnic prejudice, the relative strength of ethnic vs. national identity, and national pride).",,,,2018-03-01,2020-03-01,"Greatness United (G-United) is a national volunteering program implemented by the Government of Kenya and the Ministry of Education, in partnership with Evidence Action. The program recruits and trains recent university graduates to assist in low-performing public primary schools throughout the country to increase learning and build national unity. Applicants may be assigned to any county beside their home county, so the program is partly designed with the intention of promoting inter-ethnic contact. The program is meant to provide university graduates, who may not have good labor market opportunities, with a chance to develop new skills and build networks while, at the same time, improving government-provided educational services for young children.

In 2018, G-United assigned 1,227 volunteers to over 600 schools across 20 of Kenya’s 47 counties. In 2019, G-United will assign approximately 1,600 volunteers to 800 schools across 22 counties in Kenya. The program has increased capacity each year; at scale, it is intended to recruit, train, and deploy 10,000 volunteers annually, reaching 200,000 learners. The cost-effectiveness of this program is contingent upon improving volunteer retention at multiple stages of recruitment, and upon placement.

Like many civil service programs, G-United faces high rates of attrition, and qualitative findings suggest this dissatisfaction among volunteers may stem from the placements; prior to 2018, all volunteers were matched to counties via random assignment. This low retention increases recruitment and per-student costs, and limits the potential positive returns of the program. Attrition from G-United occurs at various stages: (1) applicants being assigned a school but subsequently not appearing for training and dropping out of the program as a result; and (2) applicants being assigned a school, initially working in that school, but then leaving the school during the school holidays and subsequently not returning. Others considering leaving the program may exert low effort, mirroring a common issue observed among public servants, especially in developing countries (e.g. Chaudhury et al., 2006). ","Our evaluation will measure the following primary outcomes:
a.	Volunteer retention in the program
b.	Literacy and numeracy outcomes of primary students
c.	Volunteer national unity attitudes and behaviors, specifically in terms of inter-ethnic prejudice, levels of identification (ethnicity vs. national) and national pride.
d.	Host school and community national unity attitudes and behaviors
e.	Job performance of volunteers in terms of volunteer productivity, and satisfaction with the G-United program on the part of school officials",,,,"Our hypothesis is that mismatch between volunteers and their assigned schools contributes to the high levels of attrition seen in the program. Accordingly, in the 2019 cohort, volunteer applicants have been randomized into two placement mechanisms: 

(i)	Deferred acceptance allocation (DA): In the first arm, a subset of applicants have been randomly selected to be assigned to counties through a deferred acceptance algorithm that takes volunteer preferences into account. This group completed a baseline survey to elicit their preferences among counties, excluding their home counties (county of ancestry and county of residence). These responses were then used to assign them to a placement county. Allocation of volunteers to schools within each county will be done randomly. Within each county, a randomly selected subset of eligible schools will receive two volunteers placed through the deferred acceptance algorithm. Both volunteers in each school are assigned in the same way.

(ii)	Random allocation (RA): In the second arm, a subset of applicants have been assigned randomly to county placements, as had been done in previous years. This group completed the same baseline survey of preferences. These volunteers were then randomly assigned to a county, excluding their home counties (county of ancestry and county of residence). Allocation of volunteers to schools within each county will be random. Within each county, a randomly selected subset of schools will receive two volunteers placed through the random allocation mechanism. Both volunteers in each school are assigned in the same way.

While price - even when low - can hinder adoption, free access induces only partial usage. For example, free delivery of chlorine solution in Kenya yielded a usage rate of only 34% (Dupas, et al, 2016). However, there is little evidence on ways to increase usage beyond this basic level induced by access. Akram & Mendelsohn (2017; hereafter, AM) explore an alternative hypothesis: If the households do not understand - or trust - expert opinion on benefits of usage and benefits are hard to measure, they may not be convinced of the returns to such a technology. In a pilot RCT, AM use household recordkeeping of children’s diarrhea incidence to help them learn the benefits of chlorinated drinking water (along with sharing information on the diarrhea rate from a comparable population not exposed to chlorine). Compared to a base policy of free access to chlorine tablets and expert advice on why to use them, this simple intervention increased chlorine use after one year by a remarkable 56 percentage points. It was highly cost-effective as well, with the marginal cost per DALY-averted at $495. We propose to build on this pilot by a) testing at a larger scale and b) investigating mechanisms, particularly those related to learning and social norms, to inform design choices for the next stage(s) of experimentation and eventually scale-up. The experimental design is further structured to test learning against habit formation: both processes require intense initial engagement and can yield sustained behavioral change, but economists know little about which is most effective for behavioral change (and technology adoption) broadly. Particularly in a space where returns are not obvious and existing information campaigns have largely failed, investigating which mental process is most operative regarding long term adoption of preventive health behaviors is crucial to policy design: do we, as policymakers, invest in subsidizing an activity repeatedly so people develop a habit, or do we invest in improving our information campaigns so individuals can better understand the returns to a behavior?",,,,2022-06-10,2022-11-30,"We propose a randomized controlled trial (RCT) across 1,800 households. We first describe the various components of our interventions, and then outline the treatment arms explicitly.

Monitoring: Biweekly health worker (HW) visits to: a) collect data on diarrhea incidence over the last 2 weeks; b) test chlorine in the water once per month; and c) offer free chlorine tablets (2-week’s supply) and expert advice on use. This mimics standard public health campaigns on chlorine distribution.

Info-tool: HW helps the caregiver record diarrheal incidence (unique episodes across children) and total diarrhea days (the sum of all diarrhea days across episodes and children), and creates a bar graph to visually represent the total diarrhea days experienced by the children in the last 2 weeks. At the end of each month (during the second biweekly visit in a month), the diarrhea days from that month are added up and colored into a month-level bar graph. This is a simple, visual paper-and-pencil tool, and AM (2017) and our recent pilots have demonstrated that low-literacy-numeracy caregivers are comfortable using it.

Benchmarks: HW shares information on the diarrhea days expected in households (over the last two weeks) that do not use chlorine (estimated using data from the experiment; more on this below); and

Habit formation with financial incentive: Caregivers are offered small daily rewards (tokens redeemable for child/household goods) if the caregiver can show empty chlorine tablet wrappers as proof of usage. Each daily reward for proper chlorine use is equal to approximately 5 US cents (with ‘proper use’ calibrated to household’s pre-intervention water consumption). 

Our four experimental arms are as follows:

Comparison (C): Monitoring minus the offer of free chlorine tablets and chlorine-testing
Treatment 1 (T1): Monitoring
Treatment 2 (T2): Monitoring + Info-tool + Benchmark
Treatment 3 (T3): Monitoring + Habit formation with financial incentive 

To determine the benchmark in T2, we will use the diarrhea results of C from the previous two weeks. HW will share this information during the bi-weekly visits starting from the second visit (using data from the first bi-weekly visits to C from the previous two weeks).

Comparisons of arms and corresponding research questions are:

T1 vs T2: What are the short and long-run effects of facilitating learning about health returns on tablet take-up and usage?
T2 vs T3: Which mechanism is more effective in generating both contemporaneous and sustained change in behavior - active learning (via Info-tool and benchmark) or habit formation (with temporary incentives)?
C vs T1: How do the effects above compare to the standard public health effort of free distribution alone?

The interventions will span months 1-6 of the experiment (Phase 1), during which HWs visit all households once every two weeks for data collection and intervention execution. Note that, for the three treatment arms, tablet distribution and testing of water (and hence incentives for T3) starts in the third month as we reserve the first two months to help the caregivers develop some pre-tablet-access record of diarrhea incidence in their households. For months 7-16 (Phase 2), HWs will visit all households once each month to observe changes in long-term behavior. In month 16, HWs will offer a final 3-month’s supply to all households (except C).

This organization believes that people living in poverty should be given income support to help them meet their basic needs. This organization aims to help promote a decent standard of living among the poor and help them deal with emergencies. Thus, the Poverty Alleviation Organization gives financial assistance to people to help them make ends meet. For example, with the financial assistance, people might be able to struggle less to afford basic needs, like paying off debts, paying rent, and buying clothes and food. Towards that mission, this nonprofit gives one-time transfers of financial assistance to people in urban slums in Nairobi, Kenya, East Africa. They give each recipient $4 USD (about two days wages) in cash. These program recipients are people who live on less than $2 per day, and half of recipients have no savings.” 

ii) Individual Empowerment Organization message: “The goal of the Individual Empowerment Organization is to promote individuals’ potential to create a better future for themselves. The organization believes that individuals are wise and know best how to help themselves become self-reliant if they have the financial resources to do so. This organization aims to empower individuals to pursue their personal interests and create their own path to independence. Thus, the Individual Empowerment Organization gives financial resources to individuals to enable them to invest in their personal goals. For example, people might use their unique talents to start a self-run business, invest in job training courses, or
create art. Towards that mission, this nonprofit gives one-time transfers of financial resources to people in urban slums in Nairobi, Kenya, East Africa.

The organization believes that people know best how to support each other and grow together if they have financial resources to do so. This organization aims to empower people to improve their own lives and those of the people and communities they care about most. Thus, the Community Empowerment Organization gives financial resources to community members to enable them to contribute positively to the lives of people important to them. For example, when people can invest in themselves, they are better able to expand employment opportunities for others, provide valuable services to their community, or teach others, including children, useful skills and knowledge.

","February 23, 2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abstract: How can governments and nonprofits design aid programs that afford dignity and facilitate beneficial outcomes for recipients? We conceptualize dignity as a state that manifests when the stigma associated with receiving aid is countered and recipients are empowered, both in culturally resonant ways. Yet materials from the largest cash transfer programs in Africa predominantly characterize recipients as needy and vulnerable. Three studies examined the causal effects of alternative aid narratives on cash transfer recipients and donors. In study 1, residents of low-income settlements in Nairobi, Kenya (N = 565) received cash-based aid accompanied by a randomly assigned narrative: the default deficit-focused “Poverty Alleviation” narrative, an “Individual Empowerment” narrative, or a “Community Empowerment” narrative. They then chose whether to spend time building business skills or watching leisure videos. Both empowerment narratives improved self-efficacy and anticipated social mobility, but only the “Community Empowerment” narrative significantly motivated recipients’ choice to build skills and reduced stigma. Given the diverse settings in which aid is delivered, how can organizations quickly identify effective narratives in a context? We asked recipients to predict which narrative would best motivate skill-building in their community. In study 2, this “local forecasting” methodology outperformed participant evaluations and experimental pilots in accurately ranking treatments. Finally, study 3 confirmed that the narrative most effective for recipients did not undermine donors’ willingness to contribute to the program. Together these studies show that responding to recipients’ psychological and sociocultural realities in the design of aid can afford recipients dignity and help realize aid’s potential.

The original KLPS sample contains Kenyans who participated in one or more of three earlier interventions: a health study known as the Primary School Deworming Program (PSDP; described in detail in Miguel and Kremer, 2004), a vocational training voucher study, or a cash grant intervention (described in detail in Hicks et al., 2015c). 

Previous results indicate that primary school deworming led to health, schooling, and labor market gains in young adulthood, even 10 years after the launch of the program (Baird et al., 2016). Although existing work does not find much evidence of substantial labor market gains due to vocational training (Hicks et al., 2015c), findings do suggest substantial self-employment profit gains, at least in the short run, due to unconditional cash grants (Hicks et al., 2015b). These sizeable direct impacts on parents provide a potential channel for the intergenerational impacts on their children that we will study in the current project, although it is possible that gains for parents in unmeasured dimensions might also influence child outcomes.

In order to measure the impacts on the recipients’ children, this project will create locally appropriate versions of both standard and innovative survey instruments designed to measure various domains of development among children aged 3-5 and 6-8.

We use a lab-in-the-field design to elicit farmers' willingness to pay across several numeraires. We randomly assigned which numeraire farmers would pay in in order to adhere to our elicitation protocol (which told farmers that their payment would be randomly chosen), but our main analysis does not exploit this random variation.

Each farmer in our sample was given three choices that used the BDM design of Becker (1964), as implemented in Berry et al. (2020). Participants were asked to state their preferences for some object, for example a lottery ticket for a pump, in some unit of payment, for example, hours of labor. After stating their preferences, a random price was drawn, and if their stated value was higher than the price, that is what they paid for the object. If their value was lower than the price, no transaction occurred.

Choice RW (Reservation Wage): We explained to each farmer that we were offering one-time, 2-hour jobs performing casual agricultural labor in a different village. We asked each farmer whether they would be willing to accept the job at 120 KSh per hour. If they answered ""no,'' we asked about their reservation wage directly. If they answered ""yes,'' we asked whether they would accept the job at incrementally lower wages until they changed their answer to ``no.''   

Choice CB (Cash Bid): We explained to each farmer that we were selling lottery tickets offering 1-in-10 odds of winning a MoneyMaker pump. We collected willingness to pay in cash by asking the farmer whether they would be willing to pay a low price of 20 KSh, and then asking the same question for increasingly higher prices, until the farmer declined the offer.

Choice TB (Time Bid): As in Choice CB, we explained to each farmer that we were offering lottery tickets with 1-in-10 odds of winning a MoneyMaker pump. We collected willingness to pay in time by asking the farmer whether they would be willing to work 30 minutes for the ticket, and then asking the same question for increasingly higher amounts of time, until the farmer declined the offer.
","Respondents' value of time, reservation wage, and predicted market wage.","We measure the value of time using three approaches. The first uses the respondent's choice in Choice RW directly (we call this the Direct Value of Time). The second uses the ratio of Choice CB to Choice TB (we call this the Indirect Value of Time).

Short-term results show that the intervention improved language development and school-readiness, particularly for children of illiterate primary caregivers. The present trial is aimed at identifying pathways for effective scale-up by testing 1) whether public pre-primary school teachers can improve participation by illiterate parents whose children would most benefit from the program, and 2) whether a bundled father encouragement recruitment strategy can increase participation of fathers and other male caregivers.

The product aims to alleviate credit constraints by allows farmers to buy insurance with ‘bite-sized’ premium payments over a period of time. In order to test for this mechanism, we experimentally vary the time when farmers are allowed to buy the insurance: in 90 randomly selected villages farmers can buy the product up four to months prior to the planting season, in another 90 villages the farmers can only buy the product a few weeks before the planting season. Moreover, we also test for the elasticity of demand by providing subsidized insurance in 90 villages. Another 90 villages are assigned to the control. We track the same group of 2,160 farmers over a period of a year, and sell them insurance for two different agricultural seasons. Household-level data is collected at three different points in time: once prior to the start of the program, once after the completion of the first season, and again at the end of the second season. We estimate the impact of insurance on investment in agriculture, the distribution of profits, asset ownership, and subsequent demand. 
",,,,2018-03-01,2019-11-30,"Bima Pima (BP) is an index-based insurance product aimed at protecting smallholder farmers against weather hazards. Pay-outs are based on rainfall during the planting season. The insurance can be bought in the form of scratch cards that cost 50 KSh each. Farmers will also have the option to buy the insurance directly through a mobile platform. Those who have already purchased a scratch card may buy additional insurance through this mobile platform to “top up” their insurance for any desired amount. The location of the insurance cover is tied to the initial BP purchase, which is calculated by cell tower triangulation. This information is collected when the scratch card’s code is registered via SMS, that is if the initial bit of insurance is obtained through a scratch card. For those purchasing their initial bit of coverage from a mobile phone, location data is collected at the time of mobile registration. 


The trial consists of four evaluation arms:
1. Pure control
2. Late access, no subsidy: farmers are sold the product a few weeks before the beginning of the planting season.  
3. Early access, no subsidy: farmers are sold the product 4 months before beginning of planting season. This grants farmers more time to purchase “top ups”. 
4. Early access with subsidy: farmers receive 50% subsidy. 

At baseline all treatment groups were visited twice, early (i.e., four months prior to the beginning of the planting season) and late (i.e., a few weeks prior to the beginning of the planting season), during which we promote the product. However, at the time of the first visit, the late-access farmers are told the product will not be available to them until closer to the planting season. For the second season, we sold the insurance at the same time in all the treatment arms. There was therefore no difference between the Early and Late treatment arms.

The randomized roll-out provides the key source of experimental variation for the study.

DEFINITIONS
- Market centers: defined as the 100 locations where the NGO planned to open retail shops
- Catchment areas: defined by all locations within 10 km of the market center
- Entrants: the NGO-run stores



DATA
Each round of data collection takes place as three separate activities:
1) We conduct market censuses in all catchment areas. Specifically, we list, geo-tag, and photograph each agro-input retailer within the 10-km catchment area (i.e., all stores that sell seeds or fertilizer).
2) We employ covert (mystery) shoppers, who purchase seed and DAP fertilizer from 10 randomly sampled stores within each catchment area listed in the census. We sample the mystery-shopped stores withour replacement (i.e., if catchment areas overlap, we exclude shops already selected to be surveyed based on also falling in another catchment area).
3) We conduct firm surveys with the same stores that we sent mystery shoppers to. This exercise is separated in time from the mystery shopping activity to ensure that the covert shoppers remain covert.

",,"RANDOMIZATION
We randomized market centers into early and late roll-out using pairwise randomization. We used the following variables to create the pairs: 
1) An indicator of whether the entrant location is within 1 km of a main road
2) Altitude
3) Number of incumbent stores within 5 km of the entrant location
4) Population density within 10 km of the entrant location

If the NGO faces difficulties opening stores in some of their planned treatment locations (for example if they can not find an appropriate piece of land), the pairwise randomization will enable us to drop that location and it’s matched control location.

VARIABLES
- Distance to main road: we label all roads classified as trunk or primary roads according to the Kenyan road system as ""main roads"" 
- Number of incumbents: we proxy the number of stores in an area using a 2015 census conducted by McKinsey of all agro-input stores in Kenya
- Population density: we use population density estimates from WorldPop (2013)
- Altitude of the market centers: from a Digital Elevation Model done by the USGS Shuttle Radar Topography Mission

MATCHING
Using the above variables, we constructed pairs of market centers following the procedure employed by King et al. (2007), i.e.:
  * Calculate the Mahalanobis distance for every possible pair of market centers within each region
  * Choose the pair with the smallest distance and remove it
  * Repeat these steps until all stores have been matched

However, these interventions tend to come with a relatively high price tag, and especially in low-income settings, can target parents with low educational attainment that may not be familiar with the best approaches to support their children’s education (Muralidharan et al., 2019; Portela and Atherton, 2020). In response to this, we evaluate an intervention that provides repeated low-cost reading materials, and low-touch behavioral encouragement to engage parents in their children’s literacy development process. We study the effectiveness of the repeated provision of properly leveled, low-cost, scaffolded materials (“postcards”) which guide parents through reading exercises they can perform with their children twice a week in an effort to improve early literacy outcomes. As such, we study this intervention through a randomized controlled trial of first graders during their first term across 112 private schools in Kenya, 42 private schools in Lagos (Nigeria), and 446 public schools in Lagos (Nigeria). Our experimental sample consists of over 23,000 students across these three settings.

Additionally, we investigate how the same educational intervention is implemented differently in three different settings. Contextual factors, implementation quality, and participant take-up are at the heart of the effectiveness of all development interventions. However, to date, much of the education literature in low- and middle-income countries has focused on the effectiveness, rather than on the rigorous documentation of the extent to which the local adoption and adaptation moderated their success. In this pre-registered analysis plan, we include a framework for how we will evaluate the implementation of the intervention in the three contexts based on our ex-ante theory of change. This framework will allow us to provide empirical evidence on the extent to which the same intervention was implemented differently in three contexts, and whether this moderated the effectiveness of the intervention. 

Please see the attached document for further details on this study.",,,,2021-07-01,2022-02-28,"The specific treatment consists of a “postcard” that students will receive every Monday throughout a full term (~15 weeks). This postcard contains two short reading passages, and one reading comprehension exercise on both sides and provides guidance for parents on how to engage on these passages and comprehension activities with their children. The content is largely the same across contexts, but the vocabulary and to a lesser degree the difficulty of the passages were adapted for each context. In an effort to maximize comparability across contexts, this intervention is set to start during the same school term (Term 1) across all three contexts. 

The mechanics of the exercises are as follows: one side of the postcard is designed to be completed the same Monday the child brings the postcard home, and the other side is designed to be completed the following Thursday. Every Thursday afternoon, our partner will send parents an SMS text reminding them to complete the exercise. In an effort to increase perceived accountability of parents, each side of the postcard will have a designated space for parents to sign and acknowledge that they completed that day’s exercise. Furthermore, every Friday, students are encouraged to bring the signed postcards back to their teachers to check for completion. ","1. Oral reading fluency (measured in units of correct words per minute) 
2. Standardized school grades for English and Kiswahili around the midterm (~6-7 weeks after the expected start of the intervention) and endterm (~13 weeks after the expected start)
3. Student dropout
4. Teacher survey on project implementation, and teacher beliefs and attitudes, also to be used to explore mechanisms
5. Parent survey on project take-up, and parent beliefs and attitudes, also to be used to explore mechanisms
","The outcomes for oral reading fluency, language test scores, and enrollment come from our partner’s administrative data. The internal data collection process is mostly standardized within our partner’s network, allowing us to make direct comparisons for most outcomes and indicators across contexts. Specifically, while oral reading fluency and enrollment are coded in the same units across all three sites, the language test scores reflect different assessments by context, so we plan to use the standardized scores (by context) when pooling outcomes for all contexts. Similarly, within each context, all children take the same test within a testing round (i.e., during the midterm or endterm), allowing for comparisons across schools within each context. 

We will also be studying the differences in implementation measures and take-up across contexts. Our main data source for this portion of the study is the teacher and parent phone surveys that will be carried out at the end of the intervention in each context. In the attached appendix, we pre-register a framework that outlines the expected theory of change of this intervention in 10 steps (from “1. Postcards are designed and adapted for the context” to  “10. Students’ early literacy outcomes increase as a result of the postcard”). We also include in the appendix the survey instruments, and a clear mapping of each step along the theory of change to the survey questions we will use to analyze each step. 

The survey data will also provide information on teacher and parental beliefs, which will allow us to explore factors that moderate and mediate the quality of implementation, and the effectiveness of the intervention. On the qualitative side, we will also have access to internal operations reports on the distribution of postcards to each school, as well as qualitative information from spot checks on the ground for a few schools. Pending travel restrictions, this set of qualitative data will be complemented with on-the-field interviews with teachers, principals, and parents.","To explore potential heterogeneity of our results, we will use individual level data on gender, school, and baseline grades. Similarly, we also use regional data on community size (population), poverty levels, adult female literacy, and relative wealth within each country. ","Beyond the specifications outlined above to directly answer our main research questions, we plan to conduct additional exploratory heterogeneity analyses with the covariates of interest within simple OLS models similar to the one described for the first research question. These covariates include local poverty, wealth, population, adult female literacy, baseline performance, gender of students, and age of students. 

The vast majority of the data used for this project consists of administrative data provided by our partner. The data that our partner will provide consists of individual-level covariates for students in the treated and control groups which include the gender, and age of the student, school that they attend, time enrolled at schools run by our partner, baseline grades and grades from a previous year if available, and outcome variables. The school-level administrative data consists of the school latitude and longitude, the total enrollment, the pupil-teacher ratio in the overall student body and in the target grade, the female-male ratio in the overall student body and in the target grade, the average principal and teacher attendance rate, along with student attendance rates by gender. We complement the administrative data with geospatial data containing information on community-level covariates. In particular, we use the GIS poverty rate raster layer from Tatem et al. (2013), and the GIS adult (15-49) female literacy rate raster layer from Bosco et al. (2017). Both of these layers are at a resolution of 1-km at the equator. Similarly, we use Chi et al. (2021) to obtain georeferenced measures of local wealth. We use the latitude and longitude of each school to create an average poverty rate, average relative wealth, average adult female literacy rate, and total population for the 3-kilometer circular area surrounding each school. ","To minimize potential spillovers of the treatment, we randomly allocate treatment at the school level. To increase power, we stratify within each context  based on the wealth level of the community surrounding each school, and the relative baseline performance. Within each strata, we randomly select one school to be treated. ",,Randomization performed using Stata 17 by researchers. ,Schools,"602 schools. Of these, 112 schools are in Kenya, 42 in Lagos (private), and 448 in Lagos (public).

The upper estimate of our power calculations is if we were to analyze data from each context separately. Using the same assumptions but replacing the average number of students per target grade and number of schools with the appropriate figures for each context, we would expect an MDE of 0.21 SD for Kenya and 0.35 SD for Lagos (private), and 0.11 in Lagos (public).

With limited opportunities for wage employment in firms, the best opportunity for economic integration often lies in microenterprise. But little is known about the best way to support the growth of small businesses among such vulnerable populations: as Jayachandran (2020) notes, the empirical literature to date is ambiguous about the returns to relaxing human capital and liquidity constraints for entrepreneurs in general. This academic and policy uncertainty is even more pervasive in relation to at-risk populations such as refugees, with a high population of female entrepreneurs among them.  

To address these questions, this study experimentally evaluates the impact of an International Rescue Committee (IRC) BILLY program designed to increase employment likelihood and income of young urban refugees and vulnerable populations in Nairobi. We pursue an individually randomized controlled trial to understand how a package of bundled services compares to an experimental control group and two different treatment arms that receive a combination of services and cash grants of equivalent cost to the IRC. Moreover, the study incorporates an incentive-compatible 'choice' arm that allows us to assess the extent to which refugees have access to information about what mix of training and cash will best allow their business to succeed.

This project will evaluate the impacts of these programs on the employment status, time use, productive assets, earnings and consumption of the target population. In addition, we will examine impacts on a range of mechanisms of impact and alternative measures of well-being, ranging from mental health to perceived self-efficacy and cognitive bandwidth.  By evaluating these impacts in parallel for populations of refugees and comparably situated native residents, our study will speak to the generalizability of the existing microentrepreneurship literature onto the crucial problem of putting refugees skills to productive employment.  
",,,,2019-09-01,2020-07-31,"The study uses an individually randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the impacts of an IRC program that provides microentrepreneurship training to a vulnerable population consisting primarily of refugees in Nairobi, Kenya. Specifically, we evaluate the microentrepreneurship track offered in the IRC's Building Income and Leveraging Livelihoods for Youth (BILLY) program. This program will be 'benchmarked' against the impact of a cash transfer equivalent in costs, and a third active treatment arm unbundles the training to examine responses to a mixture of cash and training -- again, holding total costs constant. Finally, to understand how the target population's own information may be harnessed to learn not only about their willingness to pay for specific alternatives, but also about their idiosyncratic returns to human capital versus liquidity, we implement an incentivized 'choice' exercise. 
","Primary outcomes examined in this study relate to the development of microenterprises under the BILLY program and its variants. These include employment status and hours worked, business assets and profits, and household consumption. These outcomes will be measured at endline, two years after the enrollment of the first clients, and high-frequency surveys will provide descriptive evidence on the evolving time path of these outcomes. In addition, we examine impacts on a range of mechanisms and alternative measures of well-being, including measures of participants' mental health, sense of empowerment, and satisfaction, and measures of their cognitive performance designed to understand how programs that alleviate (financial) bandwidth constraints may improve decision-making.","- The employment status will be constructed using a binary indicator variable taking a value of one if the respondent spends any time doing any wage labor, salaried work, micro-enterprise or other self-employment activity during the seven days before the survey. 
- The hours worked referred to the number of hours spent doing any wage labor, salaried work, microenterprise, or other self-employment activity during the seven days before the survey. 
- The business assets will be calculated as the sum of asset values reported as used in the client's business (tools, machinery, furniture, inventories, and other physical assets.) 
- Finally, household consumption per capita will be constructed as the sum of monthly purchase values of food consumption,  regular consumption, non regular consumption, and durables consumptions divided by adult-equivalent household members. 

",Please see above and pre-analysis plan.  Secondary outcomes will be finalized upon completion of baseline data collection.,,"We enrolled individuals who meet IRC's eligibility criteria and express interest in starting or growing a business on a rolling basis, with a new cohort every two weeks spread across two phases. 
In the first phase (Fall 2019), one cohort consists of three treatment groups:
1.  Full microenterprise program, which includes business skills training (called L2E), business grants, required participation in urban savings and loans association, and coaching and mentoring. 
2.  Business grant only, including the business grant and an additional cash amount corresponding to the cash value of services for clients.
3.  Business grant and business skills training (L2E), including an additional cash amount for the other services of the program.
The second phase of allocation began in February 2020. During this phase, the beneficiaries are assigned to either one of the treatment groups described, or to a control group that will not receive any service until after endline. 

The incentivized 'choice' exercise is conducted with participants who were randomly assigned to group 2 and group 3. Group 2 participants are asked their willingness to pay to receive the 4-day program of  business skills training (L2E), as well as their willingness to pay to receive the full suite of services offered by IRC. Group 3 participants already receive L2E, so they are only asked about their willingness to pay for the full suite of services.

This project studies an off-grid community-based micro-hydro project in Kenya. Community members contribute themselves in labor and finance towards the generation and distribution of 100 watts per client-household who pay no connection fee and a minimal recurrent monthly fee. To measure the causal effects of access to electricity, a randomly selected group of customers is connected at first, while a control group will be connected at a later date. This paper presents the pre-analysis plan for this study.",,,,2019-01-01,2021-01-01,"The project is situated in Kianyaga, 3 hours north of Nairobi, in rural Kenya. In line with the very low electrification rates in sub-Saharan Africa, very few people in this community have electricity. The community thus decided to generate their own electricity. The community contributed in labor and finance to build their own dam (on a nearby small river with a good flow on the slopes of Mount Kenya) and power house. Rather than using an expensive and technologically advanced micro-hydro turbine, the local community is using an innovative and simple strategy to generate power: a water pump set up in a reverse way as a turbine. The idea is simple: when electricity is fed in water pumps, they move water. When water is fed into water pumps (thus using the water pump in a reverse way), they generate electricity. Though simple, the idea is powerful: pumps are cheap, simple to operate, and the technology is already available in this community (and in much of sub-Saharan Africa). Since 2018, a water pump set up in a reverse way is generating 13 kilowatts of power, without interruptions. 

The plan is to connect 130 households with 100 Watts (thus, 130 households * 100 watts=13 kilowatts). Each customer will face no connection fee, and will pay a nominal 2$ per month to be used for: 1) maintenance of the project, 2) dividends for shareholder if any leftover amount and agreement on a division in shareholder's meeting, and 3) expansion to other sites if any leftover amount. ","6 Primary outcomes

With 100 watts, households can power 6 energy savings lamps, a TV, or a computer. It can be enough to power small businesses such as a charging mobile station, a barber shop, or an egg incubator. It can power lights to operate an existing business for longer hours. Hundred watts cannot power larger electrical appliances, such as large fridges, stove, ovens or agricultural tools such as electrical mills for grains, which all require thousands of watts. One can also imagine households spending more time watching TV. Therefore, the main question is whether 100 watts is enough to kick start a process of economic development. 

To verify these effects, the following outcomes will be used.

6.1 Energy savings and uses


Households may save on other forms of energy. We will test this hypothesis by collecting an energy profile for each household:

• Over the past month, how much did the household spend on (KsH)? (en48) Charcoal (en49) Wood (en50) Paraffin / kerosine (en51) Car battery charging (en52) Cell phone charging (en53) Solar (en54) Petrol (en55) LPG (en56) Batteries for torches, other devices…

Secondary outcomes will look at: use of electricity, access to other sources of electricity, aspirations with electricity.

6.2 Business Creation


The primary outcomes are:

• (bu01) Does the household head and / or spouse run a business?

• (bu24) In the last year, has the profit of your business gone up or down?

• (bu18) When starting up a business, what do you think are the main difficulties?

Secondary outcomes will look at the nature of the business (partnership), employment in the business, investment in the business (land, buildings, machinery, fixed assets)

6.3 Employment versus Leisure


An open empirical question is whether households spend more time working or increase their leisure:

• A time-use survey disaggregates time spent on: (tu1) Shamba work (farming, tending animals, etc…) (tu2) Household Chores: Cooking meals, Cleaning the house, Fetching firewood, Fetching water for home use, etc… (tu3) Washing clothes (tu5) Shopping (tu9) Any time spent with children (including helping with homework) (tu11) Non-farm paid work (tu13) Listening to Radio or Watching TV (tu14) Radio/TV: Music? (tu15) Radio/TV: News? (tu16) Radio/TV: Education Program? (tu17) Watching / Listening to household TV / Radio ? (tu18) Watching / Listening to homestead TV / Radio ? (tu19) Watching / Listening other (not homestead, household) TV / Radio?

Secondary outcomes will be:

• Time spent on phones and computers: (tu24) Does […] have a mobile phone with internet access (Smartphone) ? (tu25) Yesterday, how much time (in minutes) did [...] spend on their Smartphone? (tu30) Does […] access the internet at least once a week? (tu31) Last week, how much time (in hours) did [...] spend on the internet (Smartphone, Tablet, Computer, etc…)? (tu32) Internet: News? (tu33) Internet: Social Media/Email? (tu34) Internet: Educational? (tu35) Internet: Games? (tu36) Internet: Other? (tu37) Does […] access a computer at least once a week for non-internet related activities? (tu38) Last week, how much time (in hours) did [...] spend doing non-internet activities on a computer?

• Total income from all sources (business, farm, formal sector work, casual work)

• Days worked

• Number of days missed from work/school/daily duties

• How many hours does the HH family spend each week watching TV? (by type: news, education, entertainment)

6.4 Schooling


• Number of days missed from work/school/daily duties

• Number of hours spent on homework (during daytime? At night?)

• Grade of students",,"7 Secondary Outcomes

7.1 Access to Credit

Access to electricity may unleash business potential and investment financed by credit. The primary outcomes are:

• In the last 12 months, did you borrow any money from ...? (disaggregated by sources: a ROSCA/Merry-go-round; Informal sources: friends, family, employer, landlord; Formal financial institution: bank, SACCO, government agency)

Secondary outcomes will look at total debt from these sources, interest rate on this loan, use of funds, collateral.

7.2 Savings

Savings may increase to reinvest in the business. The primary outcomes are:

• Total amount of savings, disaggregated by sources: Formal financial institution (NSSF, bank, SACCO, post office, etc.); ROSCA\Merry-Go-Round savings; loans given out to others; M-PESA savings.

7.3 Agricultural investments

Households may use electricity to invest on their plot with powered devices:

• In the past three months, how much of the following inputs did you use on each plot? (f700a) Posho Mill (Electric) (f700b) Incubator for Poultry (f700a) Electric cutter for grass, feed for cattle (f771) Mechanical inputs (f772) Other non-labour farm inputs 

Secondary outcomes will look at days worked on plot, investment on plot, agricultural production.

7.4 Access to information

Access to information may improved with electricity.

• In the last week, which of the following did you use to learn about what was going on in the country (sl30) Daily Newspaper (sl32) News broadcasts on radio/TV (sl36) Internet: news sites (sl38) Internet: social media (sl40) Talk with friends or colleagues

7.5 Attitudes

We will look at religion and religiosity, participation in elections, social capital (social capital may decrease with electricity if people spend more time watching TV), stress (Perceived Stress Scale: PSS-10 survey), safety in homestead, trust, attitudes towards women.",,"The plan is to distribute electricity in a randomized way. A baseline questionnaire on 260 households living around the generation site and interested in getting electricity has already been collected in 2016. Individual randomization has already been completed to select 130 households. Up to now, 60 households have already been connected.

",2018-02-01,2022-02-28,"Intervention 1: REAP (Rural Entrepreneur Access Project)
REAP is a two year, graduation-style intervention that was developed and introduced in northern Kenya in 2009 by the non-governmental organization known as the BOMA Project. The REAP program aims to enable poor women graduate from poverty by helping them start sustainable businesses. The program includes financial coaching, business training and seed funds. Eligible women are selected through a rigorous process of initial wealth ranking of each household by community members, followed by household level validation facilitated by BOMA staff. Uniquely, the program facilitates the formation of three-women business groups that are the foundation of each intervention. As of mid 2017, the BOMA project had helped to launch over 5,200 businesses and 830 savings groups which have directly involved over 15,600 women.

Concretely, the graduation program targets the most vulnerable women and helps them to establish a sustainable income and savings through a two-year program of sequenced interventions: 
1.	Targeting of participants for the development of three-woman business groups;
2.	Two years of mentoring;
3.	Business skills training;
4.	A seed capital jump grant of $US 200 to start the business;
5.	Savings group training and a $US 100 progress grant (if the business remains in operation); and,
6.	Access to credit through membership in savings groups
 

Intervention 2: Index Based Livestock Insurance (IBLI) 
IBLI has been sold as a commercial insurance product in northern Kenya since 2010. The insurance relies on an NDVI satellite index to measure relative forage availability and make insurance payments when levels are much below normal for that region during that period. The index is calculated at the end of each rainy season and payouts are made when the index indicates forage is likley to be scarce during the following dry season. Since its inception, IBLI has expanded to include seven counties in Kenya and the Borena Zone of Ethiopia. The government of Kenya launched the Kenya Livestock Insurance program (KLIP) in 2015, which purchases IBLI insurance coverage for over 18,000 targeted pastoralists. ","This study will measure the impact of the interventions jointly and individually on three groups of outcomes: material well-being, subjective well-being, and expenditure patterns sensitive to intra-household power dynamics. 

We consider each of these groups of outcomes a ‘family’ for the purposes of hypothesis testing, and will use best practice methods to control the familywise error rate (e.g. Holm-Bonferroni or similar).

- Material Well-being -
We will be measuring the impact of the two programs on two outcomes in the ‘material well-being’ family: income and productive assets.

Household income will be measured by calculating the value of animal products and any other agricultural products (which are rare in this study) produced based on sale prices from the dataset and combining that with reported earnings  from other sources. 

The BOMA program is designed to directly increase ownership of productive assets by women, and by extension their households. To measure total change in productive assets, we will calculate the total value of those assets using value and price information collected in the survey. Livestock are by far the most commonly-owned assets, and for those we can use sale prices. The value of other assets is reported in the survey, and will be combined with livestock values to calculate total asset holdings.

- Subjective Well-being - 
In the category of subjective well-being, we will focus on two outcomes: reported 10-item CES-D score and locus of control, which measures the extent to which respondents feel their own choices affect life outcomes.

The CES-D Score will be calculated by summing numeric values of answers to the 10 CES-D questions, as is standard practice with this score. 

The internal locus of control index will be calculated using questions LOC014, LOC011, LOC003, LOC017, and LOC012 in the survey. For each question where the respondent answers ‘Agree’ or ‘Strongly Agree’ the index increases by one, and for each in which they answer ‘Disagree’ or ‘Strongly Disagree’ it decreases by one. We’ll also calculate and test for changes in the overall locus of control index, which uses answers from all questions.

- Women Empowerment -
The women empowerment index will be constructed based on the International Food Policy Research Institute’s guidelines for their Women Empowerment in Agriculture survey, though our questions differ slightly, as they were drawn on the BOMA project’s monitoring and evaluation program. Rather than averaging the numerical results, we will follow IFPRI in using a threshold based approach for each of two categories: expenditures and assets. The expenditures category will include questions d1-d5 in the survey (five total questions), while the assets category will include questions d6 onward (nine questions). For each category, we will count the share of questions to which the respondent answered that they have at least some say (specifically, they answered “Somewhat – I make some decisions or have a say in some decisions” or better). Results from each of the two categories will then be averaged to generate the empowerment index.

- Expenditure Patterns/ Nutrition -
We also expect that the interventions may alter household expenditure patterns, particularly toward school and nutrition. We will focus on effects in Household Dietary Diversity Scores (HDDS) and the share of boys/girls attending primary school.",,,,"This study takes place in Samburu County, Kenya. The sampling and treatment randomization process were developed to integrate well with existing processes used by BOMA. Specifically, BOMA uses a Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) for classifying households in each village into wealth categories. The poorest—usually around 50%--women are then screened for interest and potential barriers to participation. Those that pass the second screening are classified as REAP-eligible. This study samples from the REAP-eligible and the group of women that were placed in the wealth group just above the REAP-eligible threshold by their community, which we call the Vulnerable women. 

Using BOMA’s rosters from the study region, half of the REAP-eligible study participants will be allocated into the control group and half will be allocated into the treatment group. This allocation will be stratified by community.  Those in the REAP treatment group will then be allocated across five REAP treatment waves, which will be rolled out every 6 months over the first 24 months of the project. This approach aligns with BOMA’s standard operating procedure and will introduce variation in treatment durations and period since graduation, allowing us to use a continuous treatment approach for estimating impacts. Further, we have introduced variation in the distribution of REAP treatments across waves between communities, so that there will be between-community variation in the saturation of REAP businesses during midline, offering insight into spillover effects between businesses. 

Insurance will be sold by the private insurance company Takaful Insruacne of Africa, starting in February 2018 and will available to everyone in the study area. Through stratified randomization within wealth group and community, half of study participants (those from the REAP-eligible group and the Vulnerable group) will be allocated into the IBLI-control group and 50% will be allocated into the IBLI treatment group.  Within the IBLI treatment group, one third will be allocated into each of the three subsidy schemes. Insurance can be purchased during insurance windows that occur twice each year.  Those in control can purchase insurance at the commercial rates. Those in the IBLI treatment arms will receive discount coupons which they can submit to an insurance agent to receive their discount. IBLI policies last for 12 months and overlapping coverage can be purchased.

This research will examine the impacts of insurance coverage and test 3 subsidy schemes for their impact on uptake. One treatment arm will receive a subsidy scheme similar to that employed by KLIP.  One insurance subsidy scheme is similar to that offered by KLIP--100% subsidy for the first few animals and zero subsidy for additional animals. The two other IBLI-treated arms will face subsidy schemes that vary in response to the amount of coverage purchased. ",,Computer: A random number was generated in STATA for each individual in the roster.  That random number was used to allocate participants into the study and across treatment arms.,"For the allocation into REAP or IBLI subsidies, the unit of randomization was the individual.  For the allocation into saturation scheme, the unit of ranomization was at the manyatta level. For the purpose of this registration, we will focus on our primary analysis, which focuses on the impacts of each program and relies on the non-clusterd randomization.

Current efforts prioritize increasing agricultural production, whereas reducing food waste and losses, including post-harvest losses, receives much less attention in policy-making. This bias is problematic, as hermetic storage bags, for instance, provide a simple and affordable means of preserving the quantity and quality of harvested food. Hermetic storage limits atmospheric oxygen, which causes desiccation of insects and other pests that damage stored grains. 

Hermetic storage bags could thus, in principle, curb post-harvest losses and allow farmers to store their produce longer. This, in turn, could improve food security, food safety and incomes without putting additional pressure on natural resources, notably in poor areas of the world dominated by smallholder farming and high levels of food insecurity. However, as yet, the literature on human welfare impacts of post-harvest loss reduction is scarce and there is virtually no systematic empirical research on the implications of these technologies for a wide range of crucial outcomes.

This project addresses this research gap and analyzes the effects of improved on-farm storage on smallholder farmer’s welfare, in particular their a) income, poverty, and food security and b) nutrition and human health with a focus on pregnant women and newborns. We further analyse the potential of improved on-farm storage for reducing the adverse effects of fluctuating yields (e.g., due to climate change or other causes) on the main outcomes of interest. To analyze these effects, we implement a large-scale Randomized Control Trial (RCT) in Kenya. The randomly allocated intervention are five hermetic storage bags per smallholder farming household, with a capacity of 100kg of maize per bag, and a standardized training session on their use.

Meanwhile, restrictions aimed at slowing the epidemic will cause severe short-run economic impacts, particularly in the poorest communities where many may suddenly be unable to pay their monthly bills. In Kenya, we expect severe disruptions in markets to hamper the ability of firms and households to afford ongoing electricity consumption. In anticipation of this urgent problem, we propose providing emergency electricity credits to randomly-selected low-income respondents in Kenya to study the impacts of a policy subsidising utility bills during an economic crisis.

During times of crisis, do people prefer in-kind transfers or cash, and why? In this paper, we compare electricity transfers against a benchmark of cash transfers (mobile money) among 2000 rural and urban residents of Kenya with pre-paid electricity meter connections. We offer participants an incentivized choice between electricity transfers or mobile money, totaling approximately USD 10 to 15, and then implement their choice over three months. We generate three main findings. First, participants overwhelmingly prefer cash, with three-quarters of participants opting for mobile money even when offered electricity tokens with a cash value that is 40 percent higher, possibly due to the flexibility in expenditures or credit constraints. Second, despite relatively low baseline electricity consumption, preference for cash is slightly lower in rural areas, possibly due to higher transaction costs for purchasing electricity, lower mobile money penetration, or savings constraints. Third, electricity tokens transfers generate a larger increase in electricity consumption than equivalent cash transfers, suggesting a role for mental accounting; however, we estimate no impact of either electricity or cash transfers on a broad set of socioeconomic outcomes. These patterns suggest that mobile money transfers generate larger welfare gains than electricity credit, at least in settings with high mobile money penetration.

While few households in low-income countries purchase water treatment solution, Kremer et al. (2011) find that approximately half of households use a free point-of-collection water treatment dispenser designed to be convenient, salient, and public. However, Ashraf et al (2009) argue that free provision may lead to waste; Schmidt and Cairncross (2009) argue that positive impacts of water treatment on caregiver reports of child diarrhea may be subject to reporting bias and call for data on objective outcomes; and recent studies yield little evidence of child development outcomes (Stewart et al. 2018.

Our study exploits the random variation in chlorine solution availability induced by the Kenya WASH Benefits study (Null et al., 2018), and uses supplementary survey data recently collected from the study areas (Haushofer et al., 2018). We examine mortality effects over a 4-year period and across a sample of children over twice as large as previously analyzed (Null et al., 2018). ","Our setting is a subset of villages covered by Evidence Action’s Dispensers for Safe Water (DSW) program. Evidence Action, starting with a pilot of 20 dispensers in western Kenya in 2007, has since grown to operating 27,500 dispensers serving 4 million people across Kenya, Uganda, and Malawi today. We focus on their operations in western Kenya, specifically Kakamega and Bungoma county, where we are able to exploit random variation in dispenser provision from the Kenya WASH Benefits study (Null et al., 2018), a RCT which examined the effects of water chlorination on early child development. In particular, we study children born to women after January 2008, living in 132 villages (grouped into 82 “clusters” of 1-3 villages each). Of these villages, 65 had been assigned to a “water” (W) treatment and 67 to a “passive control” (C) condition in the WASH study. In the W villages, the study randomly allocated the provision of dilute chlorine solution in two ways: through point-of-collection chlorine dispensers, and provision of dilute chlorine solution (“WaterGuard”) to households with children for one year. Specifically, chlorine dispensers were installed at a subset of public water sources in each village, on average 5 per cluster. The dispensers provided a dosed amount of chlorine solution, enough to safely disinfect the typical amount of water collected. In addition, all family compounds in dispenser villages which had children under 5 years of age at the time of the original WASH study were given 1-liter bottles of dilute chlorine solution for point-of-use water disinfection every 6 months for the first year of the intervention, where each 1-liter bottle expires within 6 months. Our analysis uses survey data (Haushofer et al., 2018) that allow us to examine mortality for a sample of children over twice as large as that of Null et al. (2018) and for a longer period of time (between 1 to 3 additional years, depending on the area). 
This study estimates the intention-to-treat effect of the community-wide provision of dilute chlorine solution through dispensers and household delivery on all-cause child mortality. Following McKenzie (2012), we condition on the pre-intervention under-5 (under-2) mortality rate of the cluster to improve statistical power (ANCOVA framework). The pre-intervention mortality rate is computed with all children born between January 1, 2008 and before the roll-out of the intervention. We also estimate a difference-in-difference model which compares changes in mortality rates (before and after the intervention) across treatment and control areas for children born since January 1, 2008. For each model, we first estimate the effect of the community-wide provision of dilute chlorine solution through dispensers and WaterGuard on under-2 and under-5 (years) mortality. ,  We will look at the impact of both bottled chlorination and dispensers together, as well as just dispensers by focusing on children born at least one year after the rollout of the intervention, who therefore would not have benefitted from the provision of WaterGuard. Because it is possible that the provision of WaterGuard during the first year of the WASH-B study also influenced these women’s use of WaterGuard later on, we also conduct a robustness check in which we exclude these women from the sample entirely (including all of their children, rather than just those born shortly after the beginning of the intervention). Second, we split up the previous results further in order to examine mortality effects at different times after birth among children who survived until a certain age. In particular, we examine effects on neonatal (< 1 month), post-neonatal (1≤ months <12) and child (1 ≤ years <5) mortality. We chose these periods following the analysis of the global burden of disease due to diarrhea (and other infectious diseases) by Gakidou et al. (2017). This strategy will identify the post-natal periods where observed mortality is reduced and shed insight on survival dynamics.

Randomization will be blocked by treatment to maximize power for identifying primary effects and for interaction effects. In some cases, treatment blocks are deliberately unequal to account for budgetary constraints and low projected completion rates, but in such cases the sample is expanded to compensate for losses in power.

Outcomes evaluated include meta-survey outcomes, such as consent and survey completion (these are analysed across the set of treatments 1-3 outlined below) and also an analysis of data quality and of substantive outcomes but as they vary according to survey design features (according to treatment sets 1 and 4 below).

•	Out-of-pocket health expenditures",,"Maternal and child health knowledge and behaviour, women’s empowerment, maternal and child health outcomes ",,"The experimental design is a matched-pair, longitudinal cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT), with randomization at the village level. We first randomly selected 24 villages in the catchment area of four health facilities (six per health facility). We then matched villages in 12 pairs using Euclidean distance measures, based on village-level characteristics and aggregated household characteristics from the baseline survey. We randomly assigned one village per pair to the treatment arm by flipping a coin during a public ceremony.

The implementing partners selected four health clinics to be included in the expansion of the I-PUSH program. Six (6) villages located in the catchment areas of each of these four clinics were randomly selected from a list of all villages in the catchment areas, for a total of 24 villages. The list of villages was provided by the Sub-county government jointly with the i-PUSH program area manager. Random selection was done by the research team using a computer program.
In each village, selected CHVs and PAF’s area manager provided a complete list of households and other necessary information within the work area of each CHV. Based on household demographics and pregnancy information, eligible households were identified. Eligible households included those with at least one woman of reproductive age (WRA) (18-49) who: a) had at least one child below 4 years living with her at baseline; or b) was pregnant at baseline. The team randomly selected 10 eligible households per CHV in each village to be included in the study sample. Additional eligible households per CHV were listed to serve as replacement households for refusals and dropouts.
Initially, the study sought a 50-50 allocation between households with a pregnant woman and households with a child under 4 years old. After the household listing exercise, it became clear that there were too few pregnant women in each village to fulfill this criterion. We then decided to include all pregnant women in our sample up to 50 percent, and randomly sample additional households with children under 4 years old until the cluster size (10 households per village) was achieved. The research team did a random selection as follows: all eligible households with children under 4 years old were entered in Excel sheet and receive a randomly assigned number. 
We then conducted a baseline survey which collected information on household demographics, socio-economic indicators, food consumption indicators, financial inclusion, participation in community networks, as well as self-assessed health status, health-related knowledge and behavior, health care utilization and health expenditures, maternal health, mental health, intra-household decision-making processes and gender dynamics. We also collected village-level characteristics including demographic information, infrastructure and access to (health) services. After baseline data collection, villages were matched in pairs and one village in each pair was randomly assigned to the treatment group. 
The weekly financial and health diaries commenced two weeks after the baseline data collection was completed and will continue for 18 months from the start of the intervention. The financial diaries record all financial transactions such as income, expenditures, loans, savings and gifts, remittances and loans, including those between household members, in the seven days prior to each interview. The health diaries provide a detailed picture of the incidence of illnesses and injuries, as well as preventive and curative health care utilization. Health diaries collect data on all health events that occurred to any of the household members (respondents, their children and other household members) in the seven days prior to each interview. This includes symptoms, whether any health care was sought, which health provider was visited, health services received, out-of-pocket health expenditures, date of onset of the symptoms and date of provider visit(s). Diaries respondents are also invited to participate in a number of incentivized lab-in-the-field experiments to measure women’s empowerment, risk attitudes, and time preferences.
The study will be concluded by an endline survey scheduled after approximately 12 months of program implementation, incorporating the same modules as the baseline survey, as well as a satisfaction module on participation in the i-PUSH program for women in the treatment areas.","
","After the baseline household and village surveys, we matched villages in 12 pairs. We used the Euclidean distance for our matching process, which corresponds to the absolute difference between the standardized values of all of the covariates for a possible pair of matches. Our matching indicators included village-level indicators (demographics, infrastructure, availability of health services) and household-level indicators, aggregated at the village-level (female educational attainment, share of women earning income, membership of savings groups for women, mobile phone ownership for women, wealth, health care utilization,  health expenditures, health insurance). 
Randomization was blocked at the health facility level. Thus, each village was matched with one of the other five villages in the catchment area of its nearest health facility. This was done to ensure that each health clinic had an equal number of treatment and control villages in their catchment area. Hence we computed this distance measure between each village and all other villages within the same health clinic catchment area; “pair” the two villages with the minimum distance and remove them from the list; repeat the distance calculation excluding the pair made; and continue until all villages were paired.
After the matching process, the randomization assignment was carried out in the presence of key stakeholders including PAF, local liaison persons and village representatives, upon explaining all steps. Consent for the procedures was obtained from local government officials before the random assignment. The following steps were conducted: Papers with paired village names were folded and put in a bag; two village representatives from each paired village discussed whom would pick the paper; and after the other group members verified that the names could not be seen, one paper was picked. A Kenya Shilling 10 coin was used to decide which group the picked village belonged to by flipping the coin. The village representatives had decided that the head of the coin should represent the control group, justifying that Kenyatta (1st president of Kenya) was a controlling village and the shield to represent the intervention group. The process of choosing the folded paper and flipping of the coin was repeated for all paired villages.

It uses granular financial data from weekly household interviews covering six weeks before the first case was detected in Kenya to five weeks after during which various containment measures were implemented. Based on household-level fixed-effects regressions, our results suggest that income from work decreased with almost one-third and income from gifts and remittances reduced by more than one-third after the start of the pandemic. Nevertheless, household expenditures on food remained at pre-COVID levels. We do not find evidence that households coped with reduced income through increased borrowing, selling assets or withdrawing savings. Instead, they gave out less gifts and remittances themselves, lent less money to others and postponed loan repayments. Moreover, they significantly reduced expenditures on schooling and transportation, in line with the school closures and travel restrictions. Thus, despite their affected livelihoods, households managed to keep food expenditures at par, but this came at the cost of reduced informal risk-sharing and social support between households.

Abstract: Background
Epidemics can cause significant disruptions of essential health care services. This was evident in West-Africa during the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak, raising concerns that COVID-19 would have similar devastating consequences for the continent. Indeed, official facility-based records show a reduction in health care visits after the onset of COVID-19 in Kenya. Our question is whether this observed reduction was caused by lower access to health care or by reduced incidence of communicable diseases resulting from reduced mobility and social contacts.

Methods
We analysed monthly facility-based data from 2018 to 2020, and weekly health diaries data digitally collected by trained fieldworkers between February and November 2020 from 342 households, including 1974 individuals, in Kisumu and Kakamega Counties, Kenya. Diaries data was collected as part of an ongoing longitudinal study of a digital health insurance scheme (Kakamega), and universal health coverage implementation (Kisumu). We assessed the weekly incidence of self-reported medical symptoms, formal and informal health-seeking behaviour, and foregone care in the diaries and compared it with facility-based records. Linear probability regressions with household fixed-effects were performed to compare the weekly incidence of health outcomes before and after COVID-19.

Results
Facility-based data showed a decrease in health care utilization for respiratory infections, enteric illnesses, and malaria, after start of COVID-19 measures in Kenya in March 2020. The weekly diaries confirmed this decrease in respiratory and enteric symptoms, and malaria / fever, mainly in the paediatric population. In terms of health care seeking behaviour, our diaries data find a temporary shift in consultations from health care centres to pharmacists / chemists / medicine vendors for a few weeks during the pandemic, but no increase in foregone care. According to the diaries, for adults the incidence of communicable diseases/symptoms rebounded after COVID-19 mobility restrictions were lifted, while for children the effects persisted.

Conclusions
COVID-19-related containment measures in Western Kenya were accompanied by a decline in respiratory infections, enteric illnesses, and malaria / fever mainly in children. Data from a population-based survey and facility-based records aligned regarding this finding despite the temporary shift to non-facility-based consultations and confirmed that the drop in utilization of health care services was not due to decreased accessibility, but rather to a lower incidence of these infections.

2. Actionable information with deliberation: As above, but also sharing the information with Court User Committees (CUCs) that include representatives from public security agencies and local communities, to focus discussion around performance, create bottom-up accountability, and collectively arrive at ways to remove the bottlenecks.

The feedback forms were sent once in January 2019. The goal will be to send additional feedback forms in 2020 and 2021 every month for a duration of one year.","The primary outcome is the proportion of hearings ending in an adjournment.

We will use a difference-in-differences analysis, with court and month fixed effects.

The research plan includes subgroup analyses by:

• Baseline time to disposition

• Baseline number of adjournments, disaggregated by their main reasons

• Strength of feedback (i.e., 1) spread between CCR and recommended target, 2) number of adjournments reported, and 3) size of predicted impact)

• Nature of top reasons of adjournments

• Type of court (high court, magistrate court, emloyment and labour relations court, environment and land court)

• Type of case (civil (e.g., succession, commercial), criminal (e.g., property, violent))

The randomization was stratified on 1) regions (8), and 2) time to disposition. These stratification dummies will be added to the model.",,"• Adjournments disaggregated by reason for adjournment. In particular, adjournments can be “internal”, i.e., under the control of the judge (e.g., court not sitting) or “external”, i.e., caused by other parties (e.g., lawyer not ready).

• Case clearance rate (cases disposed of divided by cases filed) as a standard measure of productivity of courts, as well as cases disposed, cases filed

• Time to disposition: Considering the feedback forms were only sent once in January 2019, it may seem unreasonable to expect an effect on the time to disposition of cases. If additional feedback forms can be sent in 2020 and 2021 every month for a duration of one year, there may be an effect on time to disposition. Since the study period is only a year and given that it takes an average of seven months to resolve a criminal case, it is reasonable to expect an effect on the time to resolve criminal cases. In contrast, it takes on average four years to resolve a civil case, so it may be harder to detect an effect on the time to disposition of civil cases--however, some categories of civil cases are resolved faster than others, so we will narrow down on these categories by considering all case types that are resolved (on average) within the course of a year.

• Backlog (percentage of cases that have been pending for more than 1 year)

• Age of case resolved (to see whether judges decide to resolve new versus older cases)

• Time taken for case hearing

• Time taken from filing to first hearing of cases

• Legal representation

• Quality: appeal rates, conviction, dismissal

• Access: total caseload

From digitization of cases extracted from Kenya Law database at the High Court level:

• assignment of judge to litigant [both a check-of and distortion of random assignment]

• decision direction

• whether the decision is appealed

• citation count of the decision, length of decision, number of laws/acts cited in the judgement, how many times the judgement in question has been cited

• time to disposition [if scrapeable from the text of the data]

• number of published cases

• gender slant, gender access to courts

• If possible to identify economic disputes (contracts, security of property rights, credit), number of such cases; time to disposition and direction of decision in favor of certain parties (creditors versus lenders, or big firms versus individuals)

For the above data at the High Court level, the research plan includes further subgroup analyses by:

• Proportion of lower courts treated (since cases for lower-level courts will percolate the High Courts)

Additionally, a daily event study when the lower court decisions percolate into the higher court will be implemented. The dates of the lower court filing or resolution might be used as separate event study dates along side the treatment dates of the lower courts, to check whether the quality of decisions at the lower-level courts impacts the process of cases at the High Court level.

Other analysis if data is available:

• If court user satisfaction surveys are available: satisfaction with court services

• If employee surveys are available: use of case management, motivation

• If CUC meeting minutes are available: procedures put in place to deal with adjournments

• If PMMU evaluations are available: evaluation score, court use of funds (compliance of courts with budget utilization of allocated funds), attendance of judges to the yearly judicial training

If there is an effect on adjournment and time to disposition (especially if the additional feedback forms are sent in 2020 and 2021 every month for a duration of one year), then we may expect downstream economic effects:

• If Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey: investment, business creation, access to credit, consumption

However, meeting this target seems yet out of reach. 

In 2015, 2.1 billion people lacked safely managed drinking water services globally and 844 million people did not have basic drinking water services (WHO/UNICEF, 2017). Around a million handpumps in rural Africa provide water to approximately 200 million rural Africans but break frequently, wasting billions of dollars of investment (Baumann, 2009; Baumann and Furey, 2013) and forcing the poor to regularly use more distant and often dirty water sources. Recent estimates show that one in four handpumps in sub-Saharan Africa is non-functional (Foster et al., 2019) and this poses serious risks to water security. 

To reduce this risk novel professional maintenance models for rural water infrastructure are spreading across Africa. Intuitively, these maintenance models ``insure'' the handpump and protect communities against pump malfunctioning and the corresponding water insecurity. Practically, subscribing to these maintenance schemes entails that communities sign an annual contract and make regular monthly payments to the service provider to be guaranteed an effective and prompt repair and thus enjoy uninterrupted clean water provision. 

Given that water supply in rural Africa tends to be a community affair, water users are required to cooperate and invest part of their private money to be able to pay the premium and insure the pump against its breakage. Herein lies the dilemma: the subscription to the professional maintenance service relies on voluntary contributions from water-users, which are beneficial for the group, but this comes at a cost for single individuals who could have chosen to invest elsewhere. Moreover, failing to collect the needed amount of money to subscribe to the maintenance service is likely to result in water insecurity for the entire community.

Will water-users reach a collective agreement to ``insure'' the handpump through individual contributions when everybody would suffer severe consequences from the handpump break down if the community did fail to cooperate?

We designed what we call a ""the water-risk game"", a one-shot public good game with threshold. Each subject in our experiment will face the same tradeoff: the more she invests into the collective good, the higher the probability that the threshold is reached and water security will be enjoyed by all members of the community, but this comes at the expenses of her private money which she is guaranteed to receive at the end of the game if the target sum has been reached. Conversely, failing to reach the target sum implies that each individual will preserve their private money but the collective faces risks. Our intervention consists in manipulating the probability with which the collective risks water security. 

The main outcome variable we aim to capture is the group-wide contribution level and thus the share of groups who fail to meet the target, resulting from different risk levels of water insecurity. We expect the percentage of groups failing to meet the threshold to decrease with the probability of losing water security. Equivalently, group contributions are supposed to increase as exposure to risk increases. 
We will analyse the dynamics of this outcome across treatments and between groups who have already subscribed to a pump maintenance scheme and those who have not. 

We will also register individual outcomes. Specifically, by means of their individual contributions we will be able to identify in each group altruists, fair sharers and free-riders. 

Our main objective is to study whether uncertainty in water security represents a key reason why communities in Africa fail to cooperate and subscribe to new maintenance service models.

While this program will primarily target alcohol usage, we are interested in associated effects of the program on spousal relations (IPV), Intra-household information sharing, and economic productivity. We plan to include approximately 450 households (900 individuals) in 20 villages in Kakamega, Bungoma, and northern Busia countries in Kenya. We will invite a randomly chosen third of these households to participate in substance abuse trainings carried out by the Giselle Foundation, which will include both group and individual counseling sessions over four months. These households will receive the opportunity to receive a financial incentive for participation. We will employ an experimental approach that uses an auction mechanism to measure willingness to pay for agricultural inputs. We also will conduct experiments to measure time discounting and intra-household cooperation. ","A major social and economic problem in developing countries is widespread abuse of alcohol, especially among young men. In western Kenya, a highly populated area with significant levels of rural poverty, illicit sale and consumption of locally brewed spirits appears to be causing significant negative societal impacts: harming health, decreasing agricultural productivity, and leading to intra-household conflict (Mutisya and Willis, 2009; Mkuu et al., 2019). The resulting detrimental health and economic effects on women can be especially severe. Studies show that alcohol abuse among men is correlated with intimate partner violence (IPV), which often causes severe physical and psychological damage to women and children in the household (Tumwesigye et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 2014; Greene et al., 2017). In addition, alcohol abuse, primarily among men in these areas, can potentially exacerbate the unequal distribution of household labor. Men, unable to perform agricultural tasks due to alcohol consumption, rely on women in the household for these labor-intensive activities. Moreover, as men are generally managers of household finances, male abusers of alcohol are likely to allocate financial resources sub-optimally at the expense of women and children. 

Despite its severity, there has been very little research in the development economics literature analyzing methods to decrease alcohol abuse and its corresponding deleterious impact on women and economic productivity. In the Indian context, Schilbach (2019) conducted an experiment to analyze whether a commitment mechanism providing financial incentives for sobriety among male cycle-rickshaw drivers could be an effective method to decrease alcohol consumption. The results show that the incentive increased sobriety and savings, though did not have an effect on productivity. Luca et al. (2015) find that alcohol prohibition in India decreases IPV, and Angelucci (2008) finds that direct cash payments to women in Mexico decrease alcohol usage in households, although she finds mixed effects on intimate partner violence. While numerous recent studies have analyzed the effect of cash transfers on IPV in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (Heath et al., 2020; Haushofer et al, 2019; Cools and Kotsadam, 2017), there have been no economic studies in SSA to our knowledge that specifically analyze the effect of programs to decrease alcohol abuse as a primary objective on intimate partner violence.

In this study, we seek to determine whether an alcohol counseling and outreach program in rural Western Kenya can increase levels of sobriety and decrease expenditures on alcohol. While this program will primarily target alcohol usage, we are interested in associated effects of the program on spousal relations (IPV), Intra-household information sharing, and economic productivity. We plan to include approximately 450 households (900 individuals) in 20 villages in Kakamega, Bungoma, and northern Busia countries in Kenya. Households will include cohabitating spouses, where at least one spouse regularly consumes alcohol. Certified health workers will medically screen prospective participants to ensure that they are healthy enough to participate in the program. All prospective participants, with their consent, will be transported to a nearby clinic for a physical exam and blood tests prior to the start of any formal project activities. During the intervention, participants will have the phone number to a nurse on staff who will be able to answer any questions or concerns. If needed, an individual who is suffering from significant withdrawal symptoms will receive assistance from the implementing partner (Giselle Foundation) and medical support (explained further below). 

We will invite a randomly chosen third of these households to participate in substance abuse trainings carried out by the Giselle Foundation , which will include both group and individual counseling sessions over four months. These households will receive the opportunity to receive a financial incentive (currently planned to be 500 KSh per household per week). The 500 KSh is equal to about one-day's wage in this region. To receive this payment, the household should be actively participating in the project and engaged in meetings with counselors and social workers. Each week, 50% of actively participating households will be randomly chosen to receive the incentive. The funds will be transferred directly to households through mobile phone (in the absence of a mobile phone, cash will be provided). As long as the household members are participating, the funds will be transferred for the duration of the project.

These incentive payments are modeled after the aforementioned study by Schilbach (2019) in India. In his study, individuals who passed a daily breathalyzer received a substantial monetary payment, while those who were not sober did not. This study tries to mitigate any coercive aspect by providing the payment regardless of present sobriety of the individual --- the only condition is that the individual is participating in treatment activities. We believe these payments to be culturally acceptable given the wide use of payments for participation in programs in Kenya and Sub-Saharan Africa in general. Numerous studies in development economics analyze effects of behavioral changes in response to cash payments in Sub-Saharan Africa, and this study would not be unique in providing such monetary gifts.
A team of enumerators employed by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture will then conduct surveys with both treatment and control households. Surveys will include questions about the household’s agricultural activities, assets, individual’s religious membership, information network, alcohol use, perceptions of gender roles, and (for female respondents) questions about incidence of IPV. These surveys will determine whether the program has affected alcohol usage, IPV, Intra-household information sharing, and productivity among participants.

In this study, we plan to incorporate an additional intra-household bargaining component. Each spouse will have the opportunity to either keep winnings from the auction secret, or to share information on winnings with their spouse for an additional payment. This will enable us to measure Intra-household information sharing among spouses in each household. By randomizing the invitation to the trainings and workshops, we will be able to ascertain the effect of the program on Intra-household information sharing between spouses. 
Cultural sensitivity is embedded into this study, specifically through its design in partnership with local stakeholders. Reduction of alcohol abuse is a major initiative of the Kenyan government, and local NGOs, including the Giselle foundation (the implementing partner) who/which has been involved in this area already. Giselle Foundation also has a working relationship with NACADA (The National Authority for the Campaign Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse), the semi-autonomous government authority in this area.

Beyond the validation of these assessments, other important features of phone-based assessments are yet to be studied (Lupu and Michelitch, 2018). Social scientists have long discussed and identified “enumerator effects” for in-person surveys (Bischoping and Schuman, 1992; Lupu and Michelitch, 2018; Schaeffer et al., 2010; and West and Blom, 2017), where observable characteristics of enumerators drive differential rates of responses and scores for seemingly similar populations in developing countries (Adida et al., 2016; Benstead, 2014a; Benstead, 2014b; Blaydes and Gillum, 2013; Blom et al., 2007; Durrant et al., 2010; Flores-Macías and Lawson, 2008; Kane and Macaulay, 1993; Liu and Stainback, 2013;  Olson, 2007). For instance, Di Maio and Fiala (2018) find that in Uganda most observable characteristics yield minimal enumerator effects, except when enumerators are asking  highly sensitive political preference questions, which account for over 30 percent of the variation in responses. To clearly identify enumerator effects and avoid confounding enumerator and respondent characteristics, researchers would ideally fully randomize the assignment of assessors to assessees, or as West and Blom (2017) call it, create “fully interpenetrated designs”. In spite of the large body of work suggesting the presence of enumerator effects within in-person assessments, the physical logistics of “fully interpenetrated designs” can be challenging, and few studies, conducted only in the United States and with small samples, have actually conducted such a study (Di Maio and Fiala, 2018). Typically, the logistical issues have been dealt with by assigning assessors to small areas that are still feasible for assessors to move in and yet capture as much variability in assessee-assessor assignments as possible (Lupu and Michelitch, 2018). For example, in the case of in Uganda, the most disaggregated unit they can feasibly assign assessors to is villages. 

Phone-based assessments lend themselves to a more rigorous documentation of enumerator effects, in general and for learning assessments more specifically, as the enumerators are centrally located and can be randomly allocated across the full sample. One could hypothesize that in such a personal level of assessment between assessor and assessee, especially one with a degree of power dynamics between students and teachers, the level of comfort in the relationship could indeed lead to diPhone-based assessments lend themselves to a more rigorous documentation of enumerator effects, in general and for learning assessments more specifically, as the enumerators are centrally located and can be randomly allocated across the full sample. One could hypothesize that in such a personal level of assessment between assessor and assessee, especially one with a degree of power dynamics between students and teachers, the level of comfort in the relationship could indeed lead to differential response rates. 

We leverage the data collection process from a phone-based assessment in Kenya to add to the literature previously mentioned. As part of the outcomes measured in another RCT evaluation, students are given a short, phone-based assessment consisting of math questions, a student survey question, and a few parent survey questions. Assessors will be teachers from within the educational system where the RCT is conducted. Students in 3rd, 5th, and 6th grade across all 105 schools in the RCT sample were randomly selected to receive a phone-based assessment. Then, students selected to receive a phone-based assessment were fully randomized to an enumerator, as well as the order in which they are called. Therefore, there is a random assignment in the match between assessor and assessees, the day each student is called, and the order in which they are reached. Strong protocols are in place to ensure that this order is preserved. 
In particular, we will explore the following research questions:

1. Are phone-based assessments valid measures of learning?
2. To what extent are there differential response rates by enumerators?
3. Does the match on observable characteristics of assessors and assessees (e.g. same gender) drive differential response rates and scores?
4. Does assessor experience and teaching skill change the average and variability of scores?

Baseline assessment data that we will use to validate the phone-based measure consists of standardized, in-school, test score data from February, 2020, as well as July and October 2019. Given the data infrastructure of our implementing partner, the in-person assessments are standardized across all schools, ensuring the comparability of baseline scores across students. ","In terms of covariates, we will know  for each assessor the grade and school where they teach, their age, their gender, their average attendance rate, and their lesson completion rates. For each pupil, we will know their baseline scores, their grade and school, gender, average attendance rate, age, and years attending schools within our partner’s system. 
",,,"1. Are phone-based assessments valid measures of learning?
For the full sample, we will correlate the baseline in-person test scores with the overall phone-based assessment score. We will further do this for the core numeracy and curriculum-aligned sections separately. Finally, we will repeat this exercise subsetting to student sub-groups of interest such as by gender, baseline performance, grade, and different degrees of rurality of each school. We will also examine correlations with SMS text-based quiz results, although it is currently unclear whether the sample of respondents will be large enough to make this analysis feasible. Eventually, we will also examine correlations between the phone-based assessment results and a post-intervention, post-school reopening in-person assessment. Furthermore, we will examine whether results vary depending on other characteristics of the assessors for the purpose of validating the assessments, such as teacher value-added and overall experience. Finally, we will examine whether the correlation between phone-based assessments and in-class assessments weakens for students that experienced a COVID-related shock.
 
2. To what extent are there differential response rates by enumerators?
For each of the outcomes Y mentioned above, for student i, teacher/assessor j, we will explore whether any specific teacher characteristic predicts the outcome to some extent. The null hypothesis is that all teacher-level characteristics are orthogonal to the outcomes. 
 
3. Does the match on observables between assessors and assessees (e.g. same gender) drive differential response rates and scores?
For each student, we will create binary “match” variables. For instance, a female student assessed by a female assessor would have a 1 in the gender match binary variable. We will create these binary variables by gender, grade (i.e. the grade that the student is in, and the grade the assessor teaches), school, whether the assessor is specifically the student’s teacher, county and province of origin. 
 
4. Do assessor characteristics  change the average and variability of scores? 
The order in which students are assessed is also fully random, and the assessment period is expected to last about 15 days. Therefore, in expectation, students assessed on day 1 should be similar to those assessed on day 15. To test this hypothesis, we will explore the extent to which the day when a student was assessed predicts their outcomes. Furthermore, we will estimate the daily variability by assessor*grade, and run a similar model where we check whether the variance in scores by assessor changes with increased testing experience.

The COVID-19 pause on in-person schooling threatens to exacerbate learning poverty around the world.  Much ongoing scholarship on minimizing coronavirus learning loss understandably focuses on online learning. However, many young people have no access to internet at home or at school. Given access challenges, how can schools support the hard-to-reach learners most likely to fall behind? This study examines the effectiveness of academic support using a relatively basic technology—teacher-student phone calls. We will examine the causal effect of phone calls in Kenya on student engagement, school connectedness, and academic achievement. We will test two types of calls with different design features to understand the optimality of different types of remote support. In particular, this study has two treatment branches: the “accountability” arm, which will test short calls that encourage children to keep engaging with other remote resources provided to them , and the “tutoring” arm, which will test longer calls that include all the features of the accountability arm plus a short lesson on a grade-appropriate topic.",,,,2020-09-01,2020-12-23,"The RCT will take place in Bridge schools across Kenya, in a total of 105 eligible primary schools. At baseline, each school had students in grades 1-8, and had on average 253 students across all grades. This intervention focuses on grades 3, 5, and 6 where schools had on average 75 students in total, across 1 stream per grade. In total, the sample will consist of approximately ~7,000-8,000 students, pooled across all three grades. Randomization is performed at the school level, where 70 schools are assigned to treatment, and 35 schools serve as the control group. Among the treatment schools, 35 will be in treatment group 1 (“accountability”), and 35 will be in treatment group 2 (“tutoring”). For more details about design of the calls, please see the appendix (“Appendix A: Detailed intervention overview”). Finally, the expected timeline for this intervention is set to start in fall of 2020, and we expect the intervention to last ~6 weeks, although in practice it will conclude as soon as the funding for airtime has been exhausted.",Math test scores.,"	We will rely on pre-lockdown assessment data (school grades from July and October 2019, and February 2020) as a baseline measurement, and post-lockdown assessment data as an endline measurement (January and February, 2021). We will use individual subject scores separately, and a composite score, consisting of scores in multiple subjects.

	We will also conduct an endline phone-based assessment of pupil learning. Parents will be randomly sampled from the treatment and control groups. The calls will be made by our partner's staff during the week after the conclusion of the project. The focus of the survey will primarily be their child’s learning outcomes in Math. There will be two types of questions in the phone-based assessment: “core numeracy” questions, which reflect the students’ ability to do basic operations and are constant across grades, and “curriculum-aligned” questions, which reflect more what teachers discussed during the phone calls and vary by grade. We will use this assessment data as an outcome, first treating it as single test, and then treating it as two separate tests, for the “core numeracy”, and the “curriculum-aligned” questions. ",,,"There are 105 schools in the experimental sample of eligible schools . In order for a school to qualify as “eligible”, the school had to have their exact latitude and longitude available in the data system, and baseline data for our target grades. All eligible schools have one stream in grades 3, 5, and 6. Since the intervention is assigned at the school-level, the students in the experimental sample will be all students enrolled in grades 3, 5, and 6 from all 105 schools. Column 1 in Table 1 shows some descriptive statistics about the communities, schools, and classes where the experiment will take place. Figure 1 below also provide a sense of the context where these schools are located. ","Although we expect to have over ~7,000 students in the experiment, logistical constraints do not allow for class- or individual-level randomization to maximize power. Even if this were logistically feasible, we worry that this intervention is particularly susceptible to frictions between called and uncalled students, or teachers assigned to make calls and those that were not. We are aware that the disadvantage of randomizing at the school-level is that power is severely harmed, and we try to maximize power by double-blocking on covariates which we hypothesize explain some of the variation in the outcome. First, we create three bins within the state by the population within a 5 km radius surrounding each school, as a proxy for urban/peri-urban/rural location. These bins span from ~6000 people to ~55,000 for the rural category, from ~55,000 to ~170,000 for the peri-urban category, and greater than ~170,000 (until ~1,850,000) for the urban category. The GIS population data comes from Bosco et al (2017), downloaded at a resolution of 1-km grids at the equator. Then, we split each bin into quintiles representing baseline exam-scores for each school. For each school, a weighted average z-score across the target grades was calculated based on the school’s math scores. Given our partner’s approach to testing and data collection, these scores are comparable across the state. 
	This blocking procedure leaves 15 randomization blocks, each with information about the type of location, and the baseline achievement level of each school. We randomly assign treatment to schools within each of these 15 blocks. All blocks have 7 schools within them. 10 of the blocks have 5 treated schools, and 5 blocks have 4 treated schools. Among the treated schools in each block, the treatment arm (“accountability” or “tutoring”) was then randomly assigned. Among the 5 blocks with 4 treated schools, exactly half of all treated schools are assigned to one of the treatment arms. Among the 10 blocks with 5 treatment schools, half of these blocks assign 3 schools to one treatment and 2 to the other treatment, and the other half of these blocks has the inverse assignment of treatment schools, for a highly balanced distribution of treatment assignment.

The post-harvest treatment group will receive a tarp. Tarp is a plastic sheet that meets food safety standards and is used during maize drying as a barrier between the grain and soil where the aflatoxin-producing fungi live. The pre- and post-harvest treatment group will receive both Aflasafe and a tarp. All treatment groups will also be trained on the existence, dangers, and methods of preventing aflatoxin. All inputs will be distributed at baseline, before maize planting, and participants will be trained on their use at that time. After baseline survey and distribution of inputs, we will follow up with the farmers who received Aflasafe to remind them to apply Aflasafe on time.

Knowledge scores will be created for each topic separately (aflatoxin, Aflasafe, tarp).

Working closely with local extension, we will identify maize-producing sub-counties, wards, location, and sub-locations in the two counties. Then, we will randomly select 60 sub-locations from within these.  Lastly, we will randomly select 4 villages from complete village lists of each sub-location, that will generate 240 villages in total. Sub-locations will serve as randomization blocks (i.e., one village within each sub-location will be randomly assigned to each of the three treatments and one village will be assigned to the control group in each block). Aflatoxin levels in maize depend on climate conditions and the contamination levels can vary significantly between different geographical areas. Sub-location is the lowest administrative unit in Kenya, after village. Therefore, using sub-locations as blocking factor reduces the impact of geographical characteristics as a source of variability in our dependent variable. 

The assignment to input treatment groups will be randomized at the village level. The 4 villages from each sub-location will be randomly assigned to one of four groups (1 village to each group): a control (C) group and three treatment groups, including (T1) pre-harvest input only; (T2) post-harvest input only; (T3) pre- and post-harvest inputs. In this design, sub-locations (lowest administrative unit after village) serve as blocking factors. 

After villages have been randomly assigned to control or treatment groups, we will work with village elders to obtain up to date household lists for each village. We will then randomly select 8 dual-adult households from each village to participate in the study. All eight households in each treatment village will receive the relevant input(s), a training on its (their) use, and aflatoxin training. In control villages, eight households will be surveyed at the same interval as in the treatment villages, but they will not receive inputs nor training.

In addition to the main research question on the (cost) effectiveness of pre- and post-harvest inputs, we will also study the effect of gendered input and training allocation on aflatoxin levels in maize, knowledge retention, and diffusion of information within a household. Therefore, orthogonal to random assignment to treatment at the village level, we will randomly determine whether a female or a male adult member from each sampled household (all of which will be dual-adult households) will receive the input(s) and training.

Before the second follow-up survey, we decided that we wanted to understand more about the demand for Aflasafe.  Therefore, we will add a Becker-Degroot-Marschak (BDM) auction at the end of the second follow-up survey.  The BDM auction gives farmers the chance to purchase a 2-kilogram bag of Aflasafe, which is how the product is currently packaged for sale in Kenya.  Participants are also given evidence from the first round of the follow-up survey, that based on data from fellow farmers in the study, those households who received Aflasafe at harvest were on average 10 percentage points less likely to have an unsafe level of aflatoxin in their maize at time of harvest than were those who did not receive Aflasafe.

The potential bids for Aflasafe in the BDM auction range from Kenya Shillings (Ksh) 250 to Ksh 550 with a uniform distribution around the market price of Ksh 400.  The bids increase in increments of Ksh 50.  The participants will play two practice rounds of the BDM auction where they bid for cookies and pens before they bid for Aflasafe.  The participants are given Ksh 600 for their maize samples at the beginning of the survey.  This will potentially alleviate any credit constraints around purchasing the Aflasafe that participants may experience. However, the payment is not tied to the auction and participants are under no obligation to buy the Aflasafe.  

The objective of this BDM auction is to answer the following questions.
1. What percentage of farmers in the sample are willing to pay at or above the market price of Ksh 400 for 2 kilograms of Aflasafe?
2. Is there a difference in willingness to pay for Aflasafe between participants who were randomly chosen to receive Aflasafe for free in the previous season and those who were not selected to receive it for free in the previous season?",,In office by a computer using Excel.,Village (assignment to control or treatment) and household (assignment of input to male or female adult in household).,240 villages (level of randomization and clustering).,"8 farmers per village, totaling 1,920 farmers for baseline and follow-up surveys.","1.

This represents a 17% increase in the share of samples testing below 10 ppb, yielding Cohen’s h of 0.22 which is considered a small effect size (Cohen, 1988). Our final sample with all four groups includes 1,920 farmers in 240 villages.

",,,2018-01-01,2020-12-31,"VE is a non-profit that administers a micro-enterprise graduation program in east Africa.  The goal of the VE graduation program is to lift the poorest east Africans out of extreme poverty. VE’s program runs similar to an ultra-poor graduation model, as it targets the poorest members of the communities they operate in, and provides them with an integrated package of cash transfers and training. The program places a large emphasis on business skills and microenterprise development. This is important as experience shows that the extreme poor lack business skills and financial literacy, as well as access to capital, financial institutions, and markets, which limits their opportunities for generating enough income to break out of poverty. The intervention is multidimensional including three-four months of business skills and financial literacy training, access to business savings groups, seed funding for businesses, and mentoring. VE’s unique graduation approach is aimed at helping entrepreneurs launch and run a business, increase household income and savings, and improve standards of living, helping to break the cycle of poverty.

3.	Total infrequent expenditure on larger social and religious activities (wedding, funeral etc.), clothing, taxes, housing maintenance, migrations, travel and educational costs and fees over the last 12 months.

Dandora, Kenya, a slum of approximately 150,000 inhabitants in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya.
Dandora is home to the city's largest garbage dump, and many struggle to find and keep consistent
employment.
The first goal of the project is to evaluate the impact of the health care center on the population. In
particular, we propose using randomization in the value and price of vouchers to experimentally vary
expectant mothers' propensity to use the health center, and then use this variation to measure the
impact of the hospital itself. Our hypothesis is that the hospital has significant effects on maternal
well-being after the birth, as measure in severity of hemorrhaging and child well-being as measured
by birth-weight.
The second goal of the project is to measure the effect of additional wealth on maternal and child
health outcomes. This is achieved through the randomization, since we will directly observe
households' characteristics and willingness-to-pay directly, but they will report their willingness-topay
before learning the price. This allows us to compare households who end up paying a lower
price to those who pay a higher one, and thereby learn the effect of additional wealth on average.
This provides important evidence for policies like maternal leave or even maternal grants that
financially support pregnancies. Our hypothesis is that the larger the difference is between a
household's stated willingness-to-pay and the the price the end up paying, the healthier the mother
and child will be.
The third goal of the project is to evaluate existing methodologies for understanding insurance
choice. Existing studies interpret data from markets in developed countries through a complicated
framework of statistical and economic assumptions to rationalize observed decisions and outcomes.
Our experimental study will, instead, measure many of these variables directly. This allows us to
apply existing methodologies to our experimental data and determine whether the answers are
correct or not. Our hypothesis is that a number of restrictive assumptions (multivariate logit errors,
ignoring adverse selection, neglecting the subjective beliefs of market participants) are important,
and lead to misleading results. We hope to either verify that these assumptions are problematic and
suggest remedies, or verify that existing approaches actually provide the right answers.

In particular, we want to measure the impact of the introduction of a new, safe, clean hospital to a
population who has previously reported experiencing obstetric violence at the hands of care-givers
and other serious challenges before, during, and after birth. Since we are exploiting experimental
variation to measure this effect, the results will tell us the benefits of introducing similar facilities into
comparable contexts. In many countries, traditional birth attendants and relatively inferior maternal
health clinics are still a challenge to maternal health, and the study will provide evidence about how
improved facilities can lead to better outcomes for mothers and children.
This experimental evidence will be achieved by randomizing the value and prices of vouchers for
care, and offering them to study participants (described in more detail below). This provides
economic data on how people in developing countries cope with the risk of incurring large
expenditures, particularly during a Cesarean section birth. We can then use these very rich data to
evaluate the methodology used by economists and public health specialists when trying to
understand insurance choice in developed countries, and provide a critique and possible remedies.
Since we are adopting a methodology
that allows us to observe household willingness-to-pay for insurance directly, we can provide
evidence on a well-defined and clear health risk (pregnancy), as opposed to a number of previous
studies that focus on crop insurance or general health insurance. The advantage of our study is that
it is health-related and a ubiquitous risk about which women face sincere risk. Unlike crop
insurance, it is a product many are familiar with (Kenya offers national health insurance, which is
unaffordable but desired by many in our targeted population). Unlike insurance experiments in the
US or Taiwan, our targeted population suffers a lack of institutions and outside options available to
those in developed countries. Finally, many households in developing countries hold their wealth in
relationships with other households, who share financial burdens and call in financial favors when
necessary. This makes the experimental evidence more useful for development policy compared to
studies from western countries, where financial assets or credit can be used to pay for care.",,,,2017-03-01,2021-05-17,,"The main end points of interest are:
1. Maternal health: self-reported basic measures include, were additional returns to the hospital required; did mothers have to be transferred to a more advanced hospital because of complications; how long did it take for mothers to return to a normal level of activity. We ask additional questions about symptoms --- fever, swelling in legs, vaginal hemorrhage or discharge, etc. --- to get additional information about what conditions the women might have been suffering from, and whether those conditions are related to quality of care or sanitary conditions at the hospital they chose.
2. Quality of care received: self-reported measures of cleanliness and sanitation; responsiveness to mothers' requests for pain relief or discomfort; obstetric violence; forced use of beds by multiple mothers during labor or after the birth; treatment of newborns (e.g. use of incubators)
3. Child health: whether, how frequently, and how long breastfeeding took place; weight, height at birth and subsequent ages; mortality (though we are underpowered for any kind of treatment effects on this variable); and various additional diagnostic conditions shortly after birth such as distressed breathing, discolored skin, diarrhea or vomiting.
4. Care decisions: do women select higher quality places to receive care, and how does the expected price of care shift this decision. In particular, do women select to give birth at home and opt out of the formal health care system.

As this is is not a standard design with a treatment arm and a control arm but does allow selection into treatment via the BDM mechanism, we plan to use an instrumental variables approach to analyze these outcomes as well as more structural approaches. 

Define the redemptive value of the voucher as the face value minus the amount paid by the household: the net benefit of getting the voucher through the BDM mechanism. To measure the effect of getting care at this specific hospital, we will run a first stage including the voucher's price and redemptive value and measures of individual/household wealth on the decision to use the maternal center, and then regress mother and child health outcomes on fitted values and the same set of covariates in the second stage. This controls for household wealth but the random price and redemptive value experimentally shifts, conditional on x, the propensity of a household to use the maternal center. Since the price and redemptive value are random (randomized on enumerator tablet or through the BDM experiment), they satisfy the exclusion restriction. Whether they are sufficiently strong instruments will be determined by the outcome of the experiment. 

Similarly, to analyze the impact of quality on outcomes, we gather data on community perceptions (""If the price of delivery were zero at each hospital, how would you rank them"") versus revealed preferences (""The last time you gave birth, where did you go? How much did you pay?""). This allows us to rank the available options, and see how the ranking correlated with questions about the sanitary conditions, quality of doctors and staff, and other questions. We can then substitute the decision of whether the participant goes to the particular maternal health center with a quality index or ranking in the first stage, and then regress health and economic outcomes in the second stage on the predicted quality of care from the first stage.","We will look for heterogeneity in treatment effects by interacting with baseline variables, particularly whether the subject is the head of household or self-reported measures of influence with the head of household; their own financial status (income, ownership of a business). We do not construct variables like ""empowerment"", but instead use observable household roles like HoH or measures of financial independence (owning and operating her own business, private wealth and income) to understand what gives women more choice and influence over their care decisions.
","In terms of mechanisms, we are interested in a number of secondary outcomes or channels through which treatment effects might be operating:

Household stress and bargaining: did vouchers reduce divorce rates and self-reported conflict within the household?
Investments in child health and education: did the money saved on delivery allow for more investment in early childhood development, particularly nutrition and education?
",,"We randomize the redemptive value and prices of vouchers for treatment at a specialized maternal and child care facility, and elicit demand for the vouchers from participants using the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak mechanism. This provides economic data on how people in developing countries cope with the risk of incurring large expenditures, particularly when a Cesarean section is a possibility. This also provides data on how women trade off the price with the quality of care, determining what facility they give birth at or whether they elect a home birth.

","We will offer access to insurance to a random sample of women of child-bearing age in and around
Dandora, and use randomization in prices to determine the impact of the insurance and the health
center. Insurance will be offered during a baseline interview. At the endline, height-for-age and
weight-for-age measures of child health along with other basic indicators will be collected in addition
to a survey.
I will now describe the voucher distribution and demand elicitation procedure. The vouchers are
insurance contracts: respondents who receive a voucher will pay a 20 - 40 percent deposit within a
week of the survey, and the rest of the cost will be deducted from the face value of the voucher. The
deposit is a premium, and the price of a birth (normal or cesarean) less the remaining face value of
the voucher is a co-pay. We want to see how these respondents value the insurance contracts
presented to them. However, if we simply presented them with a fixed, take-it-or-leave-it price and
asked them to tell us whether they wanted to buy or not, we would only learn whether or not the
contract is acceptable at that price, not what the respondent's actual value is for the contract; we
would then have to make a variety of unrealistic statistical assumptions, such as, for example, that
the unobserved component of the respondent's value is normally distributed. So we want the
respondent to make us an ""offer"" for a contract with a given face value and deposit. Suppose we
said, ""We're going to ask you to make us an offer for this voucher. The voucher has a face value of
KES X and requires a deposit of Y percent of your offer. Whatever you answer will be the price, and
KES X and requires a deposit of Y percent of your offer. Whatever you answer will be the price, and
you have to pay the deposit within a week by mPesa (a very popular mobile money program offered
by Safaricom)."" The respondent has a best strategy of answering zero and paying nothing: this is an
even worse demand elicitation procedure, since it gives respondents a clear incentive to understate
their values. In situations like this, economists instead use the Becker-deGroot-Marschak (BDM)
demand elicitation method. It recognizes that when the price paid is out of the respondent's control -
-- as with the take-it-or-leave-it prices --- they behave in a fashion consistent with their true values,
but we want them to report a value, as in the pay-as-reported demand elicitation method that
performs so poorly. In short, BDM works like this: ""I have this voucher for KES X that requires a Y
percent deposit. I am going to ask you for an offer, and then I am going to ask you draw a price out
of this bag. If the price is above your offer, you do not get the voucher. If the price is below your
offer, you can buy the voucher at that price. You have to pay a deposit of Y percent of the price
today, and the rest will be deducted from the face value of the voucher. So you will never pay more
than what you offer, and you can end up paying significantly less."" The intuition is that if I
deliberately understate my value, I can only lose in the scenario when the price drawn is between
my stated offer and my value, so I lose when it would have been profitable to win; similarly, if I
deliberately overstate my value, I might win in the scenario when the price drawn is between my
stated offer and my value, so I win when I would have preferred to lose. This gives participants a
weakly dominant strategy to set their offer equal to their true value. The face value will be randomly
selected from $30, $50, $100, $150, $200, and $300. For reference, the price of a normal birth at
the clinic is $50, and the price of a cesarian is $300, so that we are offering a range of different risk
levels. The deposit will be randomly selected from 20, 30, or 40 percent. For statistical reasons,
variation in the deposit tells us more about the respondent's risk preferences than varying the value
value, but for economic reasons including full insurance and some under-insurance even for a
normal birth provides information about how various insurance schemes would be received by the
population.
The BDM procedure has a few consequences to mention. First, some people will not get a voucher
despite reporting a high offer, while others will get a voucher despite making a low offer. This is the
experimental variation that we want. The strategy is that winning a voucher will push people who
are ""on the fence"" about going to the new hospital into going to the hospital, and they can be
compared with people of similar observables and offers, but who did not get the voucher. This is
similar to a standard randomized controlled trial, where some subjects get a treatment and others do
not. The exact statistical methodology is called an instrumental variables regression, or two-stageleast-
squares: we use controlled variation in the likelihood of using the hospital to predict hospital
utilization, and then infer hospital impact from utilization. Second, we cannot deviate from the BDM
procedure ex post and provide vouchers even if the reported offer was below the randomly drawn
price. This undermines the demand elicitation procedure because people might reveal to neighbors
or relations that we sell the voucher afterwards regardless of the outcome; everyone then also has a
weakly dominant strategy to report a price of zero, observe the outcome of the price randomization,
and then buy if the price is favorable. 

Deviating from the BDM procedure and selling the voucher ex
post at the randomly drawn price is also not in standard experimental practice in economics:
misleading participants or misrepresenting experiments disqualifies research at most journals. 
The reason is that it encourages participants to ""meta-reason"" about the
interaction and undermines their trust in experimenters in general. Thus, instead of measuring how
health uncertainty determines willingness-to-pay for insurance, we are measuring the subject's
uncertainty about our intentions and what the outcome of the experiment is. Economics as a
discipline tries to avoid introducing this kind of meta-uncertainty into subject pools since it has
negative consequences for all economics experiments. During a trip to Kenya, we piloted this kind
of procedure for simpler goods like bags of sugar and tea, and participants understood relatively
quickly how it worked, especially after doing one or two practice rounds, which are part of the
protocol.

In addition to the BDM procedure, we have a simple procedure for eliciting beliefs about the risk of a
cesarian and the likelihood of becoming pregnant. The procedure involves a sheet of paper with two
boxes and ten beans or other counters. One box is labelled ""Cesarian Section Birth"" and the other
is labelled ""Normal Birth"". The enumerator begins by saying, ""If you think you will have a normal
birth for sure, place all the beans in the Normal Birth box"", and does so. Then she says, ""If you think
you will have a Cesarian section birth for sure, place all the beans in the Cesarian Section Birth
box,"" and does so. Then she says, ""If you think a normal birth and a Cesarian section birth are
equally likely, put the same number of beans in each box,"" and does so. Then she says, ""So now,
move the beans back and forth between the two boxes until you think it reflects the chance you need
a Cesarian section."" This is also done where normal birth and Cesarian section birth are replaced
with the likelihood of becoming pregnant. This helps us measure the subjective beliefs of the
subjects about the likelihood they become pregnant or require much more expensive care.
In the absence of the vouchers, care at the Health Center requires payment. There are free
government facilities, but these are commonly known to be low quality and stressful places to give
birth. There are several facilities nearby that offer better services for prices comparable to what the
Health Center is charging. The vouchers will therefore deduct from the price of care that households
must pay, but will mostly not fully reimburse the household for care received.
I will now describe follow-up procedures. Women who receive a voucher and deliver at the Health
Center will be indicated in bills received by the hospital, but we will have no indication whether a
woman who does not receive a voucher or who receives the voucher but does not deliver at the
Health Center gave birth. We will return to survey areas at the endline and contact parents to
schedule a survey (we will record GPS coordinates of the place of the initial interview and whether
this is the woman's current residence or place of business). The endline survey will be identical to
the baseline survey, where the current questions about all previous births are restricted to births
since the baseline, and other questions whose answers do not change over time are dropped.","Randomization on Tablets and a Public lottery: the face value of the voucher and the deposit percentage of the price that must be paid up front are randomized on the tablet at the start of the baseline survey. Study participants are shown the possible prices as laminated pieces of paper, the pieces of paper are dropped into an opaque cloth bag and shaken, and then they select a price themselves. The participant pays the deposit percentage up front, and the rest is deducted from the face value of the voucher. The redemptive value of the voucher is the face value minus the balance after the deposit is paid.","The randomization unit is the individual woman in the study: the price each woman faces is randomized.
We record whether women are members of the same household, and will cluster results at the household level.","7000 women

Climate change is expected to further exacerbate farmers’ vulnerability to extreme weather. The anticipation of possible losses discourages farmers from making productivity-enhancing investments, trapping them in low-risk yet low-return agriculture. Agricultural insurance complemented with other risk-reducing practices is often cited as a sustainable approach to unlock investments in agriculture for smallholders, improving their resilience and productivity. Thus far, the number of successful insurance schemes targeting smallholders is limited, however, because of high monitoring and verification costs of traditional insurance, combined with low demand for index-based insurance—designed to eliminate the need to verify losses—mainly due to poor trust and basis risks (i.e. the imperfect correlation between farmers’ actual losses and insurance payouts). This project aims to overcome these problems through climate-smart picture-based insurance (PBI), which uses cellphone imagery to verify losses, observe management practices and promote the adoption of productivity-enhancing yet resilient technologies through bundling with stress-tolerant seeds. Ground pictures help reduce monitoring costs, minimize basis risks and create synergies with climate-smart resilience technologies. By taking pictures of insured crops, farmers engage directly in the insurance process, improving trust and tangibility. We measure the impacts of this approach by means of a cluster randomized trial in 7 counties from different regions in Kenya. We randomly assign local village entrepreneurs who provide farmers in their communities with insurance and seeds into one of three treatment arms: a) no insurance marketing efforts (control), b) marketing of the climate-smart PBI product (treatment), and c) marketing of a comparable index-based product that does not rely on smartphone pictures for claims settlement (placebo).

2. Marketing and other promotions by champion farmers of stress-tolerant varieties for targeted crops (maize, sorghum and green grams).

This is caused by limited adoption of climate-smart agricultural (CSA) innovations due to risks and uncertainties associated with increased incidences of droughts, floods, changes in prices, crop diseases/pests, and storm. High dependence on rain-fed agriculture means that farmers are vulnerable to climatic shocks and their impacts. To take risks and invest in CSA innovations, farmers will need incentives. Such incentives should address production and market risks as well as informational constraints, contemporaneously. The SNV-led ‘Climate Resilient Agribusiness for Tomorrow (CRAFT)’ program offers incentives including (1) farm-level training in CSA practices and technologies; (2) agricultural extension services; and (3) value-chain linkages (VC) through contracts and index-insurance to encourage smallholder farmers in Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania to adopt climate-smart agricultural innovations. Improved adoption would enhance productivity and household welfare. Through a field experiment, we assess the effectiveness of these incentives for the adoption of CSA innovations, and ensuing impacts on farming system resilience, productivity and household welfare.

In regards to the second objective, the primary outcomes include: land productivity; as well as labour productivity. Land productivity is measured as the volume of output (Kg or value of production (UGX)) produced per hectare, while labour productivity is the volume of output (Kg or value of production (UGX)) produced per man-day in a given cropping year.","The main variables of interest with regard to the first objective include trainings, defined as participation and intensity of participation, by farm-household’s main decision-maker and/or their spouse, in organized training workshops concerning climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices and technologies in a given cropping year. Intensity of participation is defined as the number of times the decision-maker and/or their spouse participated in organized training workshops. Farm-household visits, defined as the number of times the farm-household’s main decision-maker and/or their spouse visited farmer field schools (FFSs) or demo sites in a given cropping year. Extension visits, defined as the number of times any agricultural extension agent or officer visited the household or farm in a given cropping year. 

Collective bulking and marketing, defined as farm-household’s participation in collective bulking and marketing of soybean and any other crop and livestock products in a given cropping year. Contract farming, defined as participation by the farm-household in contract farming arrangement for soybean and other crop or livestock products in a given cropping year. Agricultural insurance, defined as the use of agricultural insurance including index-based insurance for soybean and any other crop or livestock in a given cropping year. 

Gender, defined as Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI). This index will be developed using twelve indicators namely, autonomy in income; attitudes about intimate partner violence against women; respect among household members; input in productive decisions, ownership of land and other assets; access to and decisions on credit and financial accounts; control over use of income; work balance; visiting important locations; group membership; and membership in influential groups.

For the second objective, the main variables of interest include quantity harvested (kilograms) per crop, quantity sold (kilograms) per crop, quantity of livestock (cattle, goats, sheep, pigs, etc.) and poultry sold; market price (UGX) for crops and livestock sold; land area (hectares) under each crop; family and hired labour (man-days); value of production (total quantity produced multiplied by the farm gate price); production costs (UGX) for crops and livestock; household size; and types of food consumed. These variables will be used to construct both the primary and outcome indicators.","The secondary outcomes include: (i) proportion of households accessing input (or financial) credit; (ii) proportion of households reporting access to better quality inputs such as improved seed; (iii) proportion of households reporting having sold high quality output; (iv) proportion of households reporting having sold output at a relatively higher than average market price; (v) proportion of households adopting CSA practices and technologies; and (vi) the intensity of adoption of CSA practices and technologies. We define adoption intensity in two ways. First, as the number of CSA practices and/or technologies used by the farm-household in a given cropping year. Second, as the number of hectares or the proportion of total cultivated land that is under the CSA practice such as zero/minimum tillage and soybean-cereal intercrop or CSA technology such as drought-resilient seed and rhizobia inoculants. For CSA innovations, a third definition applies as the amount (or value) of improved seed and rhizobia inoculants applied per hectare.

For the second objective, the secondary outcomes include revenues, total household income, share of soybean income in total household income; and nutrition. Revenue, defined as market price multiplied by quantity sold will be computed for all crop and livestock/poultry products sold by farm-households in a given cropping year. Total revenue will be the summation of revenues from crop and livestock/poultry enterprises. We shall also compute the share of soybean revenue in both the total revenue and revenue from all the crops.","Practices. Defined as climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices such as minimum/zero tillage or intercropping used by the farm-household in the production of soybean and other crop and livestock enterprises in a given cropping year. Technologies. Defined as climate-smart agricultural (CSA) technologies such as drought-resilient seed or rhizobia inoculants used by the farm-household in the production of soybean and other crop and livestock enterprises in a given cropping year (two cropping seasons).

Household income will entail total income earned by all members of the farm-household from all the crops grown (per hectare); livestock and poultry kept as well as other incomes from other farm and off-farm sources and activities in a given cropping year. We shall deduct all costs involved to secure each type of income. Income per adult equivalent will also be computed for well-being comparisons across households with different number of members. We shall then compute the share of soybean income in total household income. 

Nutrition, a proxy indicator namely women’s dietary diversity score (WDDS) will be developed from different food groups consumed by women in a household over the 24-hour recall period. The different food groups are formed from different food categories including cereals, roots/ tubers/plantains, legumes, oil seeds, vegetables, fruits (including juices), meats, dairy products, fats/oils, among others.
","Three small and medium agribusiness enterprises (SMAEs) namely: ACILA enterprises, ALITO Joint, and OKEBA operating in the eastern, northern, and western and central regions, respectively are implementing an intervention involving three key incentives. First, farmers organized in groups are trained through training workshops to create awareness and their understanding of different CSA practices and technologies. Thereafter, trained farmers begin to access agricultural extension services through demonstration sites or farmer field schools (FFSs) established within their communities. At the demo sites, the extension agents also residing within the same communities practically teach farmers how to apply different CSA practices and technologies. Second, the SMAEs facilitate smallholders’ access to quality inputs either directly through direct sales on cash/credit, or indirectly through brokered linkages with agro-input dealers. Upon harvest, farmers sell their output to the SMAEs at a higher than average market price. This SMAE-farmer relationship is established through either a written or verbal contract. Through this relationship, input and output market risks are addressed. Finally, the SMAEs with support from SNV identify key insurance service providers to sell index-based insurance to farmers. Farmers pay half of the premium while the other half is subsidized by the government of Uganda. Index-based insurance insulates smallholder farmers against risks associated with weather changes including excessive rains or seasonal drought.

Famers do not pay for the supply-driven training and extension services. However, farmers may incur other costs associated with travels to and from the training venues and demo sites. We combine training and extension and label these push incentives since both incentives address informational constraints and any uncertainties associated with the technologies. On the other hand, demand-driven technologies/inputs such as improved seed, and insurance services are accessed through production/marketing contract, and index-based insurance incentive instruments, respectively. In other words, farmers have to decide whether or not to participate (buy) in contract farming arrangements (index-based insurance). Therefore, production/marketing contract is labelled pull-1 while index-based insurance is labelled pull-2 incentive. 
 
We form different combinations (bundles) of push and pull incentives and assess their effectiveness on adoption intensity of CSA practices and technology before assessing impacts of CSA innovations on factor productivity, incomes and household welfare. The bundles include: (i) push; (ii) Push + Pull-2; (iii) Push + Pull-1; and (iii) Push + Pull-1 + Pull-2. Incentive bundles/combinations of push and pull incentives can potentially effectively address the multiplicity of risks and other constraints faced by smallholders thereby improving adoption of seemingly profitable innovations such as improved seed and rhizobia inoculants. In other words, raising adoption might require incentive bundles that address various risks and constraints, contemporaneously. This is particularly important because standalone incentives are normally offered to address specific risks or constraints but not a continuum of risks/constraints. 

The SMAEs roll-out the intervention to the participants in phases by targeting new farmer groups every season for two years (Table 2). Also important to note is that, index-based insurance becomes available to farmers in the second year due to the delays in the identification and selection of insurance service providers. Therefore, we implement a concurrent stepped-wedge Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial (CRCT) with SMAEs to assess among their farmer groups the effectiveness of the four incentive bundles. Randomization is done in three steps. First, we randomly assign farmer groups across seasons due to phased roll-out of the intervention where new farmer groups are enrolled at the beginning of a new season. Using block-cluster randomization approach, we randomized farmer groups (clusters) into three instead of four cropping seasons because the SMAEs (blocks) had already selected beneficiaries for the first season of 2020 by the time of randomization. Random assignment of farmer groups to the seasons helps us to randomly determine the sequencing of enrolment of farmer groups into the CRAFT program. Second, farmer groups were randomly assigned to push or push + pull-1 incentive bundles. Finally, we randomize access to index-based insurance among farmer groups that begin to receive push or push + pull-1 in either year 2020 or year 2021.

Each farmer group starts with (1) the business as usual condition or the baseline phase in which usual farming without incentives is assessed, followed by (2) a second (mid-line) phase in the year 2020 in which 73 farmer groups receiving push (T1-1 and T2-1) and/or 76 farmer groups receiving push+pull-1 (T3-1 and T4-1) incentive bundles are compared with 92 and 88 control farmer groups that begin to access push (T1-2 and T2-2) and push+pull-1 (T3-2 and T4-2) incentives in the year 2021, respectively (Table 1).  In the final (end line) phase, five more comparisons can be made. That is, 89 farmer groups receiving Push+Pull-1+Pull-2 (T4-1 and T4-2) are compared with: (i) 87 farmer group receiving push (T1-1 and T1-2) incentives; (ii) 77 farmer groups receiving push+pull-1 (T3-1 and T3-2); and (iii) 78 farmer groups receiving push+pull-2 (T2-1 and T2-2) incentives. Similarly, recipients of Push+pull-2 incentives are also compared with recipients of (i) push, and (ii) push+pull-1 incentives. Noteworthy, 180 farmer groups that wait to receive interventions in the year 2021 serve as the control groups for assessment at the mid-line period. Farmer groups that began to receive push and push+pull-1 incentives in the first year (2020) continue to receive the same incentives in the second year (2021) except that part of these are randomly assigned to receive index-based insurance as an additional incentive (the last two bars in seasons 1 and 2 of year 2021 in Figure 1). We collect data from 2,533 households on several variables of interest at the baseline period in the year 2019 before implementing the CRAFT program to facilitate measurement and estimation of outcomes of interest such as adoption intensity.

It is possible to have cases of non-compliance or partial compliance within treatments. Due to different number of incentives in each incentive bundle, each treatment can have different degrees or levels of compliance. We can define two types of non-compliers: never-takers that will always reject a new intervention if they are offered it, and always-takers that will always receive a new intervention even if they are not offered it (Ye et al., 2014). For instance, a member of a farmer group in the push treatment is regarded as a complier if he or she takes both the training and extension services, but would not have done so if it was not offered. A member is regarded as a partial complier if he or she takes only extension services or only training but not both. There is a possibility for farmers to access inputs and technologies and other services under a (verbal or written) contract and, for some reasons, still sell soybean output outside the contract. In this study, a farmer takes up pull-1 incentive if he or she sells the largest share or all of marketed soybean output to the SMAE, regardless of receipt of inputs and other services. A farmer takes up pull-2 incentive if he or she uses it, irrespective of whether or not it was bought. By design, receipt of pull-1 and pull-2 incentives depends on receipt of push incentives. Therefore, it is not possible that a farmer can access only pull-1 or pull-2 incentives. However, a farmer can choose not to take push incentives although such cases are expected to be very rare. Instead, there might be cases where some farmers take only extension services or training. Similarly, a farmer can take both or part of push incentives but chooses not to take pull-1 or pull-2 depending on assigned treatment.

The effects of the four incentive bundles will be assessed in two ways. First, we estimate the average intention-to-treat (ITT) effect among those assigned to treatment (incentive bundles). The ITT effect reflects how farmers respond to te randomized offer regardless of their actual take-up of the treatment. Second, we can account for non-random compliance by using the random offer as instrumental variable for non-random take up of the treatment, yielding a local average treatment effect (LATE).",,Randomization was done using a computer ,A farmer group (cluster) is the unit of randomization.,329 farmer groups,2533 households,"87 farmer groups Push + Pull-1 + Pull-2, 77 Push + Pull-1, 78 Push + Pull-2, 87 Push","The Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE) for adoption intensity between recipients of Push or Push + Pull-1 incentives and those in the control condition is 11.9 percent and 11 percent, respectively. The detailed description of power calculations is indicated in the pre-analysis plan.
At a power of 0.8, we would detect an increase in adoption intensity by about 15.4 percent due to exposure to push+push-1+pull-2 treatment relative to a case where push recipients remain in a counterfactual scenario. Relative to counterfactual scenarios for push+pull-2 and push+pull-1, a power of 80 percent would, respectively, detect an increase in adoption intensity by 23.2 percent and 23.5 percent due to exposure to push+pull-1+pull-2 incentive bundle. Similarly, at a power of 80% we would detect an increase in the number of CSA practices and technologies by 23.5 percent and 24.4 percent due to exposure to push+pull-2, compared to push and push+pull-1 in the counterfactual situation.

However, relatively few studies have tested the effectiveness of employment programs for rural youth. At the same time, adoption rates of improved agricultural technologies among smallholder farmers remain low due to supply chain complications. Our study seeks to provide insight on both fronts. We will also contribute to the understanding of psychometric measures and better business practices on the entrepreneurial success of rural youth. We accomplish this by conducting a randomized control trial where rural youth in Eastern Kenya were trained in business concepts and linked with agricultural input suppliers to become resellers of agricultural inputs to smallholder farmers.",,,,2021-12-06,2022-12-31,"We made changes to this pre-analysis plan on the AEA Registry Website in Nov. 2022 before our final survey, but the changes were not saved on the website. We are updating this document ex-poste to be be transparent in the changes made.

The study will include a treatment group and equally sized control group. The intervention will randomly select youth groups in Machakos, Kitui and Makueni counties of eastern Kenya. The randomly selected youth in each group will be paired with a local agro-dealer to sell post-harvest inputs such as hermetic bags and low-cost grain moisture meters to smallholder farmers and rural grain traders. During the post-harvest period following training, youth will sell inputs on a commission basis. The agro-dealer will provide the youth with the inputs and receive a portion of the commission from the revenue generated from the youth’s sales. The value of the inputs the youth will receive at baseline will be approximately 2500 shillings (US $25) in value. Youth will also put up 500 shillings (US $5) of their own money in collateral for the agro-dealer. The youth will also receive a one-time allotment of 1000 shillings (US $10) to cover initial travel costs to allow them to transport and sell the inputs at various locations such as markets or directly to smallholders. Since these Eastern Kenyan counties have two growing seasons in one year, treatment youth will be followed and surveyed after each post-harvest selling period. The first post-harvest period is in February-March 2021 while the second is July-August 2022. After the second post-harvest period (endline), youth in the control group will receive the same training, be paired with a local agro-dealer, value of inputs, and travel stipend. They will also be required to put up their own money in collateral. ","1. Income from all sources (both from the intervention and additional sources)
2. Aspirations (for both income and assets)

Updated additional outcome:
3. Expenditures","1. Youth will be surveyed and asked about their income sources from both the intervention and other additional activities. Treatment youth will be asked about both sources while control youth will be asked only about other income generating activities. Income was calculated by asking about total revenue earned from and total costs incurred from specific activities. By subtracting total costs from total revenue, we will have the income generated from all income sources. Total income will simply be an aggregation of income generated from each activity. We also asked about the main times of the year of these receipts from each income generating activities. 
2. Aspirations will be measured as suggested by Bernard and Taffesse (2014). We will ask about what are the maximum and minimum monetary values possible for both personal income and assets. Participants will then be asked about their current level and aspired levels for the value of both dimensions. We acknowledge that directly asking about their aspirations could bias our results since they are self-reported values. However, aspirations are subjective in nature and not directly observable. Bernard and Taffesse (2014) recommend asking about aspirations as previously described for framing purposes. First, asking respondents about what is possible in their communities and then reminding them of their current level and finally asking them about a realistic goal. This approach has been used and replicated by numerous studies in the literature (for examples see Bernard et al., 2014; Janzen et al., 2017; Larue et al., 2021)

3. After pre-testing our baseline survey, we decided that in addition to income, prior monthly expenditures were a good measure of economic welfare in addition to income. Our expenditure variable is a total of multiple forms of expenditures.","1. Better Business Practices (we decided this was not relevant to our study given the fact that control youth were not asked these questions given that none of them were exposed to the treatment)
2. Value of sales
3. Treatment youth aspirations (for number of customers and value of sales) (we decided that this outcome was not relevant during the baseline survey and as such will not be used in a formal analysis)
4. Subjective feeling of income","1. To measure better business practices, we adapt a list of 18 appropriate questions to measure better practices from the one used in McKenzie and Woodruff (2017). A respondent’s answer to each question is assigned a one or zero with one meaning they are currently implementing the associated business practice. This variable represents the aggregate number of business practices being employed with a maximum possible score of 18 and minimum of 0. 
2. Value of sales is measured as the aggregation of the value of sales for each input sold. The value of sales for each input was calculated as the number of units multiplied by the price at which the associated input was sold.
3. Aspirations were measured for value of sales and number of customers for treatment youth only. The reason for this is that treatment youth had no current levels of either dimension so they will not be included in this part of the analysis. We employ the same approach outlined in the ‘primary outcomes explanation’ section.
4. We added this measure of subjective well-being towards income to our intermediate outcomes to examine if self-beliefs were consistent with aspirations post-treatment. Specifically, we asked youth if they felt that there income was higher in the year after treatment compared to the year pre-treatment.

2. Control: 20 youth groups (200 youth)","We ran a small pilot that included 10 youth resellers and one agro-dealer during the post-harvest season of July to September 2021 that follows the short growing season. Using the revenue baseline mean of 13,400 Kenyan shillings from the pilot, we assumed an increase of 5 percent as a result of the training, which would be in line with the average increase in sales from business training interventions as discussed in McKenzie (2021). We based our standard deviation assumptions based off the standard deviation of 0.05 for sales in McKezie and Puerto (2021). They ran an RCT with 3,357 firms in 157 rural markets in Kenya where firms were randomly assigned to receive business training. Knowing that we most likely wouldn’t be able to achieve nearly as large of a sample size given financial resources and time constraints, we assume a standard deviation of 0.15 for revenue. This higher value is warranted given that a smaller sample size will have higher levels of variability in the main outcome variable. We concluded that we could detect a reasonable MDE between 800 to 1300 Kenyan shillings with a sample size in the range of 250 to 350 youth participants. This was determined assuming different scenarios with intra-cluster correlation coefficients of 0.01, 0.04, 0.07, and 0.1. These scenarios gave us a cohen’s d value of 6 to 10 percent. These calculations were also done assuming 0.05 significance level, 0.8 statistical power, and a cluster size of 10 youth (per youth group). To account for expected early attrition, we determined that our ideal sample size would be to oversample and recruit 400 youth to take part in the intervention. This attrition is important to note as rural youth can be a transient group that may relocate in search of economic opportunities (Bezu & Holden, 2014). This number was also comparable to the size of the treatment and control groups in other youth employment studies conducted in Kenya (see Alvares de Azevedo et al., 2013; Hicks et al., 2015; Honorati, 2015; Brudevold-Newman et al., 2017).

Risk of low-attention is especially high in remote and self-administered settings, owing to the lack of direct monitoring and supervision by lab staff. As remote and self-administered surveys are increasingly preferred for conducting research, the risk of inattention becomes increasingly prevalent. 

In this context, we will test the use of a set of established survey inattention measures (Craig & Meade, 2012; Berinsky et al. 2019), tailored to the Kenyan population but with a generalizable framework that can be used in similar contexts. These will allow us to detect low survey attention in a wider cross-cultural study while expanding the literature on survey inattention in remote surveys. Literature suggests that respondents tend to respond differently on a range of substantive indicators (Bowling et al. 2016). Removing inattentive respondents from a dataset because of data quality therefore poses a risk to the generalizability of estimates. Faced with the issue of inattention, we test two basic interventions in order to reduce survey inattention. These are:

- A small financial incentive for answering a question in the survey correctly
-The placement of an obvious attention check early in the survey (Hauser & Schwarz, 2015) 

Implementing the above provides the opportunity to measure the sensitivity of attention to interventions specifically designed to manipulate it. With this, we will be able to derive recommended survey design features to reduce inattention in mobile surveys.

In this study we are providing an additional analysis of the effectiveness of training among SMEs, but the training we are analyzing is one that has been delivered to thousands of SMEs across the developing world and is thus, highly standardized and already being heavily invested in. Moreover, we are testing whether the business training is more or less effective when completion is immediately followed by access to a business loan. The study uses data generated from an RCT run by Technoserve Kenya in early 2021 to evaluate their training program among SMEs through Mombasa and Nairobi. Of the just over 14,000 SMEs that applied to participate in the program, a randomly selected one-third was assigned to receive Technoserve’s standard phone-based training program immediately and receive a loan in the size they applied for immediately afterwards, one-third was assigned to receive the training immediately but not receive the loan they applied for until two months after training, and the final one-third was assigned to receive the training followed by the loan they applied for four months following the training of the first two groups. A random sub-set of each group was surveyed and audited for performance before the initial training began, and three and a half months afterwards. Differences in assets, business practices, and performance across groups will be analyzed, and how these differences vary by business type, intensity of COVID-19 cases, and change in knowledge following training will also be analyzed.",,,,2021-03-12,2021-07-31,,"1.	Business owner knowledge and practices: Changes in business practices, loan repayment, and change in knowledge to assess whether anything was learned in the training.

2.	SME performance: Average daily sales and number of customers, asset counts and types, and growth in employees and inventory.
","The business practices we are measuring are:

1.	Adoption of business budget
2.	Maintaining cash savings
3.	Having an investment plan and goal
4.	Having updated and consistent business records
5.	Use of online marketing and sales platforms
6.	Use of digital payments
7.	Regular engagement with distributor and/or manufacturer
8.	Use of formal contracts with suppliers
9.	Innovativeness as assessed by enumerator

These measures capture items included in the training modules. However, to avoid testing too many outcomes, we will develop composite measures of practices with items 1-4 measuring financial practices, 5 and 6 measuring digital practices, 7 and 8 measuring supply chain management, and 9 measuring innovativeness.

Measures of what was learned from training will be based on knowledge tests.
","We will test whether the effectiveness of training and the extent to which immediate access to a loan changes it varies depending on the size of the business (primarily by comparing dukas to non-dukas), the modules of trainings that the owner/managers completed, the extent of new knowledge the business owners gain through the training, and the type of phone the business owners receive training through (smart phone versus basic phone). In addition, we will also test heterogeneity across owner/managers’ education, and work experience.",,"Over 14,000 business owners applied for a small business loan in response to Technoserve’s call for applications by filling in an application form that asked questions about the business and business owner background. Following the application window, 4,793 applicants were assigned to receive the training followed by the loan immediately (group 1), 4,252 were assigned to receive the training immediately and access to the loan 2 months following training (group 2), and 4,967 were assigned to receive the training followed by loan 4 months following group 1 and 2’s training (group 3). 

Following randomization, just under 5,000 businesses dropped out of the program largely because of the training requirement. Of the remaining businesses, 3,272 are in group 1, 3,180 are in group 2, and 3,595 are in group 3. 

Our design allows us to test the short-run effects of training, and how they vary by immediate access to financial capital in the form of loans. In particular, comparing changes in performance and business practices between groups 1 and 2 and group 3 before group 3 receives the training will provide an estimate of the effectiveness of business training. Moreover, comparing the performance and practice differences between those in groups 1 and 3 relative to changes between groups 2 and 3 will provide information about whether providing an input that is complementary to business training while the training is still fresh on business owners’ minds enhances the effectiveness of training.

Importantly, Technoserve did not want to deny training or loans to any businesses interested in taking them up, and had a limited window in which they needed to disburse the loans. Thus, the lag between group trainings and loan disbursements only allow us to measure short-run differences in performance and practices. However, whether any short-run effects lead to sustained benefits is also something we will test.
In order to be eligible for the loan, all participants had to complete a financial training module and pass a knowledge test. Participants were given access to other training modules on inventory management, supply chain management, marketing, and alternative revenue streams. Participants were assigned loans in the amounts they applied for.

As the training and knowledge tests were completed via phones (either through WhatsApp or SMS depending on what type of phone business owners possess), we are able to observe which modules they spent time on, and which knowledge tests they completed and how they scored.

A randomly selected subset of SMEs in each group was selected to participate in the baseline survey, and subsequently in the midline survey at the end of June, 2021. This survey and audit assessed business performance, loan status and use, and business expectations. An endline survey will be conducted by the end of year, 2021.
",,"Technoserve used a clustered randomization approach to assign participant SMEs into experimental arms. First, a cluster was defined as the unique combination of sub-county and geographical neighborhood as identified in the business address of the participant SMEs. Subsequently, 419 clusters were identified from the total pool of 14012 SMEs who showed primary interest in the training. Next, these clusters were randomly assigned into the three experimental arms. Each arm eventually contains about a third of the clusters. Finally, all participant SMEs with businesses in a given cluster were assigned the same treatment status. The randomization into the three groups was performed using Stata's (gen uniform()) command with the seed set at 92187.",Small and medium enterprises (SME) subcounty-locations,419 subcounty location clusters were randomized across groups; SMEs in 361 of these clusters participated in the program.,"We have program application data for a total of 14012 SMEs; Technoserve randomized clusters of SME subcounty-locations into treatment groups from this pool. Eventually, 10,047 SMEs in 361 clusters from this pool participated in the loan and training program, and around 550 were surveyed to collect baseline and midline characteristics and outcomes.","Average number of SMEs per randomized cluster is around 34 in Group 1, 31 in Group 2, and 35 in Group 3. Clusters per treatment group are 140 in group 1, 139 in group 2, 140 in group 3. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In developing countries, this gap is particularly pronounced both in urban and rural settings. Even though the literature has given increasing attention to this issue, it has partly neglected the psychological dimension that could contribute widening this gap. Under this perspective, women risk being more disadvantaged than men because of mental load, the management underlying household activities. This burden is mostly carried by women, and it may have harmful effects on their health, their labor productivity and, more broadly, their empowerment. Following the recent literature on scarcity, according to which poverty negatively impacts cognitive functions and economic outcomes, the aim of this study is to analyze the gender-differentiated impact of mental load on labor productivity controlling for attentional constraints as leading mechanism. To test for this hypothesis, we propose a lab-in-the-field-experiment where participants will be exposed to a scenario inducing thoughts about mental load, and then they will be asked to perform an effort task. ",,,,2022-05-18,2022-06-16,"We want to examine whether women's mental load, i.e., the management behind household activities, negatively affects cognitive abilities and labor productivity through a lab-in-the-field experiment. The treatment consists of priming in the mind of the participants thoughts related to mental load. They will then be asked to perform an effort task for 30 minutes during which they will have to divide black from red beans, and to complete as many Towers of Hanoi as possible with 4 and 5 disks. In the last slot, they will be asked to choose whether they rather perform the Tower of Hanoi with 5 disks or the beans again. This last information will be used to test whether mental load leads individuals to self-select into less cognitive-demanding tasks (i.e., sorting beans) because their mind is already overloaded by thoughts related to the management of the household activities. We will also test whether mental load leads individuals to make an income-maximizing choice based on information they have from the previous two rounds. 
The choice of the two effort tasks is slightly gendered: while dividing black from red beans is a gendered task for women, and requires low cognitive skills, the Tower of Hanoi is slightly gendered towards men. ","There are three primary outcome variables of interest: labor productivity, self-selection into less cognitive-demanding jobs, and optimal choice of income maximization based on previous productivity levels. ","Labor productivity will be measured as the income earned by the participants in the effort task. These two different tasks allows also for disentangling the impact of mental load on more automatic tasks (i.e., dividing beans) and on more proceduralized tasks (i.e., the Tower of Hanoi). The second outcome of interest will be a dummy variable which will be equal to 1 if the participant chooses to perform the Tower of Hanoi with 5 disks, and 0 if she chooses to sort beans in the third round of the effort task. The third outcome of interest will be a dummy variable equal to 1 if the individual choose the income maximizing option in the third round or not. Based on the productivity levels in the first two rounds, we will build the dummy variable which is equal to one if the participant makes an irrational choice, i.e., if she/he chooses for the third round to perform the task in which she/he was less productive during the first two rounds of the effor task. ","Secondary outcomes will be the average number of moves needed to complete the Towers of Hanoi and the average time needed to complete each Tower. We will also look at the grams of beans divided in each round, and the separate income of each task. ",,"Participants in the treatment and in the control group will be exposed to the same activities but in different orders. Participants in the treatment group will be first exposed to the treatment before being asked to perform an effort task. After the effort task, they will be exposed to a Digit Span Task to measure their attention level, they will have to self-assess their own stress level, and they will finally answer basic socio-economic questions. Participants in the control group, on the other hand, will be asked to compile the socio-economic questionnaire first, and then to perform the effort task. After the effort task, they will be exposed to the Digit Time Span and they will have to self-assess their own stress level. They will also have to complete a simplified version of the Raven's matrixes. Finally, they will be exposed to part of the treatment. 
The treatment consists of three parts: first, participants will have to compile a time use module under the form of time diaries; then they will be asked to recall their most pressing worries and thoughts related to the household; and finally they will have to link these thoughts and worries within the schedule of a typical workday. To do this last exercise, they will have to look first to a short video with role models (i.e., inhabitants of Kibera) talking about their worries and thoughts in relation to a normal weekday. The scope of the video is twofold: first, it should trigger thoughts related to mental load by having participants identify with the subjects in the video; second, it should help participants to better understand the nature of the exercise we are asking them to engage in. 
The effort task will last 30 minutes. The 30 minutes will be divided into three-time slots of 10 minutes each. During the first two slots, participants will have to divide black from red beans and to complete as many Towers of Hanoi as possible with four disks. For the last time slot, participants will have to choose whether they would rather complete as many Towers of Hanoi as possible with 5 disks or divide black from red beans again. ","To ensure that all participants spend the same amount of time in the experiment, they will all be exposed to the same activities. Participants in the control group are asked to complete the socioeconomic questionnaire prior to the effort task to make sure that any potential differences in the outcomes of interest are not due to differences in cognitive fatigue. On average, the socioeconomic questionnaire takes the same amount of time as the treatment.
We identify two potential mechanisms through which mental load can impact productivity. The former operates through the attentional constraint: because attention is a limited resource, we hypothesize that mental load, by charging individuals with constant daily thoughts about the management of household activities, reduces their attention at the workplace and, consequently, their productivity. The latter channel involves stress: mental load can increase stress levels, which can in turn either increase or decrease productivity. To test for these two mechanisms, after the effort task we collect data on self-reported stress, by adopting a stress scale validated in Sub-Saharian countries, and we ask participants to complete the Digit Span Task, a psychological task widely used to measure working memory and sustained attention. We randomize the sequence of the modules for each participant to ensure that the structure of the questionnaire has no effect on the responses to these questions. We will then use this information to check whether these two factors mediate the impact of mental load on labor productivity. 
Participants in the control group will also be required to complete a simplified version of Raven's matrixes. We will use this information to check for correlations between the performance in the Tower of Hanoi and individuals' cognitive abilities, as well as to check whether higher cognitive functions predict the endogenous choice into a more automatic task (i.e., sorting beans) or into a more proceduralized and more cognitive demanding task (i.e., the Tower of Hanoi with 6 disks). We do not expose participants in the treatment group to this module for two main reasons. First, we are not interested in checking whether mental load reduces fluid intelligence, but rather attention. As we already ask them to perform the Digit Span Task, we do not want to overload them with the Raven's matrixes. Indeed, participants in the treatment group will be exposed to a series of activities that require focus, concentration, and are more emotionally charging than participants in the control group. Second, a reasonable concern could be that, as the Tower of Hanoi is correlated with individual problem solving skils, we would need to control for that in our empirical analysis. To be able to control for fluid intelligence and problem-solving skills we would need to collect this information before any other experimental activity. However, this could impact the performance in the effort task, as the Raven's matrixes can increase cognitive fatigue. As randomization should ensure that cognitive abilities are normally distributed in our sample, we decided not to include this module for participants in the treatment group.

Research on social learning has often focused on adoption of new technologies in agriculture, where recent findings suggest that information diffusion can be remarkably limited. For example, across different contexts: farmers are uninformed about farming practices of their neighbors (Duflo et al 2011); information diffusion only occurs within selected networks (Bandiera et al 2018); incentives are necessary to increase the flow of information in villages (BenYishay and Mobarak 2017). 

Is information diffusion indeed limited? If so, what are the barriers and how can we overcome them? Recent papers have begun to dig into different barriers to sharing or seeking information, such as stigma in appearing uninformed and not wishing to be blamed for bad outcomes. We add to this literature, in the setting of small-holder farmers in Kenya, studying the willingness to pay for, and the diffusion of, two types of information: external information - that which may be provided by agricultural extension, and is not currently available among farmers in the village; and internal information - that which is already known to some farmers in the village. 

For the external information, we elicit willingness to pay for the information, under different scenarios of who else will also receive the information. For the internal information - information about the farming practices of a knowledgeable farmer in the village - we test willingness to pay for the information, and run information sharing games in which we incentivize seeking or sharing the information, and vary whether or not incentives are made common knowledge.

  ",,,,2022-03-15,2022-05-31,"As detailed in our experimental design, several of our outcomes are based on willingness to pay for information under different conditions. The main interventions of the project are when we provide incentives for social learning about farming techniques, incentivizing either sharing or seeking of such information, and keeping the incentives private or making them public. ","For the soil-test part, the primary outcomes are willingness to pay (WTP) of the original respondent (OR) for the information under the three different treatments, and the direct elicitation of WTP to keep information to themselves.

For the knowledgeable farmer (KF) part, the primary outcomes are WTP of the OR for the KF information, WTP of the KF not to share the information, and performance on the test at the end of the information game across the different treatment groups.",,"For the soil-test part, WTP of the neighbor for the information.

For both parts, multiple survey questions contextualizing information sharing practices, and the importance of relative position, within the village.",,"We work with a sample of farmers who will call original respondents (OR) to do two exercises.

In the first, the soil test information exercise, we randomize the ORs into three treatment groups, and elicit their willingness to pay for the results of a soil test performed in the village, under the three different conditions (one per treatment group):

1. The OR will receive the results
2. The OR will receive the results and one of their neighbors will receive the results
3. The OR will receive the results. One of their neighbors already has the results. 

For groups 1 and 2, after providing their WTP, they will also have their WTP elicited under condition 2 and 1, respectively (so the 3 treated groups are really 1 then 2, 2 then 1, and 3).

In the second exercise, with knowledgeable farmers (KF), we elicit the OR's WTP for information about the farming practices of the KF, someone who the OR has identified as being a knowledgeable farmer in the village. We then implement an information game, in which we give the OR one week to find out various pieces of information about the KF's farming practices. After that week, we test the OR on the information. We randomly assign OR-KF pairs into five treatment groups: a pure control, and incentives to seek vs incentives to share (paid according to performance on the test), cross-cut with whether the incentives are only disclosed to the incentivized party, or whether they are made common knowledge within the pair. 

To provide additional information, we also do surveys with ORs, neighbors, and knowledgeable farmers, collecting information about information sharing practices and norms, and collecting WTP of neighbors for the soil test results, and WTP of knowledgeable farmers to not share information about their agricultural practices.",,Randomization done in office by a computer,Randomization is at the individual level (the level of the original respondent),400 original farmers ,"400 original farmers, 400 knowledgeable farmers, 150 neighbors","For the soil test experiment, original respondents are split evenly across the three treatment groups, which thus each have 130:

We study how providing information about bus safety to passengers affects the demand and supply of safer public transit when firms have market power. We collect measures of safe driving for buses belonging to five firms operating at one of the busiest long-range bus stations in Nairobi, Kenya, using a newly developed tracking device. In a first experiment, we privately inform passengers approaching the station which firm is the safest choice. Passengers do not respond to the treatment, although they are willing to switch for a small subsidy. In a second experiment, we then provide a public signal to both passengers and firms that buses are now being tracked. Passengers receiving private information about bus safety now respond by choosing the safe firm, and some firms provide safer services. We rationalize these effects in a game-theoretic model of firms facing different costs of providing safe services and derive welfare estimates of alternative equilibria.

Contributions to the private pot will not be observed by the spouse. Contributions to the household pot will be multiplied by 2x and divided between the participant and their spouse. Contributions to the household pot will be revealed to both spouses.  A participant that maximizes household income should allocate all experimental endowment to the household pot.

The participant is told that they will be able to purchase some vouchers in the lab. They can either purchase these goods with allocation from the private pot, in which case, their consumption will not be seen by the spouse. They can also purchase any of these goods together with their spouse after their investment proceeds from the household pot is distributed.

The game will be played for six rounds. One of the rounds for the participant and one of the rounds for each spouse will be randomly implemented. 
1.	Three rounds of fixed endowment (100 Ksh., 150 Ksh., 250 Ksh.): endowment is observable to spouse.
2.	Two rounds of lottery endowment: spouse will know that participant drew from a lottery but not the realization. The lottery pays out 0 Ksh. with 10% probability, and 100 Ksh. / 150 Ksh. / 250 Ksh. each with 30% probability.
3.     One round of choice: participant chooses between 150 Ksh. fixed endowment (observable to spouse), or lottery endowment (realization unobservable to spouse). The choice is unobservable to the spouse.

Participant couples will be cross randomized in division of the household pot. Husbands and wives will receive 25%/75%, 50%/50%, or 75%/25% respectively of the household pot. 

To summarize, a participant who maximizes household income allocates all endowment to the household pot. There are three reasons why a participant may allocate endowment to the private pot: (1) control of resources, as the participant retains full control over resource in the private pot, (2) hiding income, as the resource in private pot is unobservable, and (3) hiding consumption, as the consumption choices from private pot is unobservable. I study whether participants allocate more to the private pot when income is unobservable. In addition, I study whether they choose different types of gifts when income is unobservable and whether they behave differently depending on the share of the household pot they will receive.

Using the household survey, I study whether couples have incomplete knowledge of spousal income, and whether misestimation of spousal income is due to hidden income. The couples will first be surveyed separately, where they are asked about their own income, expenditures, savings, transfers, as well as their knowledge of their spouse's income, expenditures, savings and transfers.

In particular, this study focuses on the influence of these social norms in the context of agricultural extension activities. Social norms ingrained in individual beliefs and preferences can influence how individuals respond to information dependent on the gender of extension agents.

Households where no household member has a mobile phone will be excluded, since the protocol includes SMS reminders. Individuals under age 18 will be excluded from serving as respondents.


Recruitment, baseline survey and randomization (visit 1). 
We will recruit eligible households into the survey by going door-to-door in target villages. Once a household is recruited into the study, we will conduct a baseline survey with the primary decision-maker for chicken and with the primary decision-maker for eligible cattle. The baseline survey will collect detailed socio-demographic information from the households.
This survey will also collect information on livestock and poultry management practices. 
Furthermore, we will measure each respondent’s memory capacity at baseline using a digit-span task.

Randomization will be conducted at the household level. Treatment status will be assigned by a random number generator in SurveyCTO. Enumerators will remain blinded to the treatment status until after they administer both baseline surveys. Treatment status will be revealed once both questionnaires are complete. 

Intervention (visit 1, treatment group). After the baseline survey and randomization are
complete, farmers in the treatment group will receive training on how to keep the books and
report the data. They will be provided a paper and pencil template to record cattle and chicken
health and productivity outcomes for three months between the baseline and endline survey.
Specifically, the treatment farmers will be incentivized to keep detailed records on symptoms of
ECF and deaths in cattle as well as symptoms of ND and deaths in chickens. They will also keep
detailed accounts of ECF and ND prevention and treatment measures like application of
acaricides, deworming, and antibiotic use. Treatment group farmers will receive a small financial
incentive to keep these records. Each of the two primary caretakers in the treatment household will  receive 100 KSH in Airtime every two weeks if they keep records for their animals (cattle for cattle caretakers and chicken for chicken caretakers).

Random checks on treatment group (visit 2, treatment group). Participants in the treatment
group will receive a weekly reminder via SMS to complete their records. Additionally, an
enumerator will check on the books at one to three random points in time. All households will
receive at least one visit, and a small subset of the treatment group will receive two or three visits.
As long as the books are up to date during the random visits, participants will continue to receive
the incentive. Up to date is defined as having records entered within the past week. Enumerators
will take a photo of the book pages at every random visit for verification and tracking purposes;
participants will keep books in their possession. If the book is not up to date during the visit, enumerators will return the following week.  If the book is up to date at that time, participants will resume receiving payments.

Willingness-to-pay. At the end of the three-month period in which treatment farmers engage in
record-keeping while control farmers do not, we will elicit from the primary chicken decision-maker
willingness-to-pay (WTP) for ND vaccination for different quantities of doses.
 WTP is defined as the maximum price a farmer would be willing to pay for a product such as acaricide or ND vaccine. We will implement the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM)
mechanism for estimating the WTP for ND vaccine. In the BDM mechanism, the subject first
states her WTP for each quantity of ND vaccine. We then randomly select one of these quantities to offer a randomized subsidy to the subject. For that quantity, we randomly draw a price from within a reasonable range (not exceeding the commercial price of ND vaccine). If the randomly drawn price is lower than the stated WTP, the subject must purchase the vaccine at this random price. On the other hand, if the randomly drawn price exceeds the stated WTP, the subject is not allowed to purchase the vaccine at that price. Enumerators will be accompanied by veterinary directorate staff who will bring the vaccines with them and provide them directly to households choosing to purchase the vaccines. To study demand for acaricides, we will offer the cattle caretaker the opportunity to purchase bottles of acaricides at the market price. Enumerators will bring the acaricide bottles with them and provide them directly to households choosing to purchase the acaricides.

Years 1978, 1992, 1991, 2002 and 2009 received the highest amounts of rain as compared to other years such as 1979, 1993, 1995and 2008 received the lowest amount of rain. During these years, farmers suffered losses and there was famine. Farmers were more poor. This made some farmers to start practicing some mechanisms to enable them protect themselves from dangers of limited rain. Therefore, as farmers, we learn that rainfall distribution can never be uniform throughout the year and over years. Some months or years receive more rainfall than others and this could have an effect on the maize growth hence farmer need to do something if they are to improve on their maize farming which requires higher amounts of rainfall.","Under this, the respondents will be given varying information on weather changes for Machakos County. One treatment group will be given historical annual information for Machakos county and the second treatment group will be given monthly weather forecasts for Machakos county for the year 2020 starting from January 2020. The control group, will be given unhelpful information on weather forecasts, they will be given information on the history of Machakos county. The treatment information will be accompanied with an audio explanation of the treatments. ",The payment will be determined by payoffs from the incentivized game. The maximum amount of money is Ksh. 50. The choice of an adaption strategy informs the amount to be paid to the participant. This follows the utility maximization theory that a farmer adopts a given adaption mechanism basing on the net utility he or she obtains from the given adaption strategy selected. ,randomization done in office by a computer.,Individual,1000 individuals,"10000, 5000 Treatment group and 5000 control group",5000,0.05,"Name: Maseno Univeristy Ethics Review Committee

Another group is exposed to two written testimonials from students who tried counseling on campus and shared their experience. First, I assess the impact of the information interventions on posteriors about the prevalence of help-seeking experiences and intentions among university peers. In the main analysis, I plan to study the impact of the two information treatments on participants’ stereotypical beliefs (i.e. negative representations of help-seekers), efficacy beliefs (i.e. beliefs about the perceived need and effectiveness of counseling), and help-seeking behavior (through incentivized measures of demand for mental health support). ",,,,2022-07-04,2022-09-30,"Participants are randomized into one of three groups:

The first measure relies on agreement with two statements borrowed from the psychological literature on stigma attached to help-seeking for mental health. The second measure relies on the assessment of two traits of the character of the vignette.

Efficacy beliefs are elicited both by referring to the character of the vignette and to the respondent. The questions assess the likelihood of symptoms remittance for the character of the vignette in the absence of therapy, the hypothetical likelihood of symptoms remittance if the respondent experienced similar symptoms, and expected benefits from counseling for the respondent. For each question, answers are measured on a Likert-type scale and will be converted in a standardized index. 

Willingness to pay is measured using a Becker-deGroot-Marschak procedure in which participants formulate a bid for the counseling voucher. The bid is compared to a price determined by a random number generator on Qualtrics.

Once misinformation starts to propagate, it is difficult to counteract. Numerous psychological experiments have shown that displacing misinformation is challenging even in controlled lab settings (Lewandowsky et al., 2012). In this project, we instead aim to ``inoculate'' people against misinformation through teaching them how to identify and avoid sharing misinformation. In collaboration with the non-profit organization First Draft News, we developed a text message based course to inoculate people against misinformation and test its effects on sharing behavior through a survey-based field experiment in Kenya. ",,,,2022-07-09,2022-07-31,"We develop two text message courses, then combine them into a third, that focus on addressing different reasons people share misinformation while inoculating them to protect themselves from misinformation. First, people may share misinformation as an intuitive reaction to emotional stimulation. The ""Emotions'' course focuses on teaching a ""Stop and Think'' strategy to counteract this intuitive reaction. In particular, the course teaches that emotions like fear, anger, and superiority are often primed by misinformation. 

Second, people may share misinformation because they do not know it is misinformation. The ""Tactics'' course focuses on teaching different techniques used to create misinformation and how to identify them. Specific tactics taught by the course concern misleading graphs, imposter websites, and eyewitness media. 

The ""Combo'' course teaches the concepts from both the Emotions course and the Tactics course. This course addresses both potential reasons that people share misinformation to test whether the combination of skill sets from the two courses is most effective at changing participant behavior. To ensure that both the length of the text messages and the number of days in the course are the same as the Emotions and Tactics courses, the content of those courses was streamlined.

In addition to the three treatment courses, we will have two control treatments. In the ""No-course'' control, participants will receive no content between the pre-survey and the post-survey. Conditional on completing the post-course survey, they will receive the Combo course. The ""Reminder'' control course sends a text message each day reminding participants that misinformation is harmful for five days. The goal of this control treatment is to separately identify the effect of the course content (i.e., inoculation) and the potential reminder effect of a daily text message on misinformation.

After participants sign up for the course, they will receive one message per day for five days, unless they are a part of the control group that receives the text message course after completing the post-survey. Participants in this ""no-course"" control receive no content for five days, then the post-survey, then the ""Combo"" course. Each day’s content will be less than 1200 characters. Some days have interaction questions. Participants must answer the questions in order to proceed to the next day’s content. The primary goal of the questions is to engage participants with course content, but they also serve as a check on treatment exposure.

We aim to learn whether the skills taught by the inoculation course are substitutes for an accuracy nudge. Accuracy nudges are an effective means of decreasing misinformation sharing (see Pennycook et. al, 2021). In our experiment, the accuracy nudge is randomly assigned to users when they start the pre-survey. Participants who receive the accuracy nudge are asked the question ""To the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the claim in the above post?'' for each post prior to asking the participant if they would share the post, in both surveys. Participants who do not receive the accuracy nudge are asked the accuracy question for all posts after answering the sharing question for all posts, in both surveys.  ",Self-reported sharing behavior with respect to social media-like posts containing misinformation.,,,,"The experiment will consist of a pre-survey, the text message course, and a post-survey.

We will recruit our sample from the English-speaking population in Kenya who are at least 18 years old using two methods. First, we will recruit participants using Facebook advertisements. We expect the distribution of participants to be similar to Facebook users' distribution in Kenya, which is younger, more educated, and more likely to be male than the Kenyan population (see Rosenzweig, 2020). Ads will appear on Facebook and Messenger, where users will see the opportunity to ""Earn AIRTIME by signing up for our FREE, five-day text message course and completing short course surveys.'' Clicking on an ad will lead users to the pre-survey. Participants are told that those who complete the pre-survey, text message course, and the post-survey will receive KSH 115 in airtime, conditional on completing all attention checks (we pay KSH 55 to participants who do not correctly answer all attention checks). In the pre-survey, participants will respond to social media posts, provide demographic information, and opt-in to a ""free text message course that teaches you how to protect against misinformation.'' In the post-survey, participants will only respond to social media posts.

Participants will be able to sign up for the course at the end of the pre-survey by providing their phone number. They will also choose whether to receive the text message course via SMS or Whatsapp, a messaging platform with 97% penetration in Kenya. We will recommend that users select Whatsapp and list it as the default based on the recommendation of the text message course distributor.

The post-course survey will be embedded in the text message on the last day of the course (i.e., Day 5). In addition, we will congratulate participants for completing the course the day after the last message and remind them to take the post-survey.

After the survey, the nurse will arrive for the home visit to offer administering the vaccine to household members at a nearby vaccination site that is within minutes walking distance. The choice to use nurses to mobilize participants to get vaccinated at a nearby site, rather than administer the vaccine door-to-door, was in order to follow government regulations of vaccine transportation.

Proponents of strategic other regarding preferences point out that individuals make choices to optimize (reward and punish) others through mechanisms specific to the eventual moral.

Even more, when operating within a minimal group, individuals care about what others will do in relation to decisions they are about to make.

i. Self reported empathy scores
ii. Average donations made to others.
iii. Average amount of donations reciprocated.","Primary outcomes will be taken in the absolute values in the estimations. The word ""average"" only considers that in the estimation, only averages matter.",,,"The study intends to follow a 2 (Empathy treatment) by 2 (observability) randomized experimental design within a donation game. The design follows the procedure below:

i. Empathy-altruism hypothesis [validation] • Randomized treatment to empathy.

– Study experimentally induces empathy using the commonly used perspective- taking task (the act of perceiving a situation or understanding a concept from an alternative point of view such as that of another individual.) The idea is to have player A in the donation game think about the feeling/emotion and perspective of player B ex-ante then respond to the donation game questions. The treatment group will be shown a case of a suffering Kenyan listed on the Mchanga platform and who is in need of assistance. A full profile of the individual shall also be provided in text 1.
– The control group observes a collage of pictures showing weather conditions. Then they are asked to choose one that best suits the general weather condition the previous day [yesterday].

ii. Success of empathy treatment [Validation]

• Subjects are presented with three lexicons (words) describing empathetic feelings. To
ensure continuous elicitation of feelings, we assume a slider version of the scale running from 0 to 100. Participants slide the cursor to a point in which they feel empathetic, concerned, and sad. There shall be an example (with unrelated questions) on how to use the slider before the actual survey questions2.

iii. Reputation [Full cross randomization to observability treatment.]

• Before the donation game subjects are randomized in a sequential dictator game round.
Half are randomized to start their round of play. However, before playing, they are made
aware that their decisions will be made public to the other half of the subjects prior to their round of play. The randomization on the round of play each subject is assigned is communicated accordingly on the computer screen. The second-round players are not observed.

iv. Reciprocity

• The context is that within minimal groups, individuals give to their group members and
expect reciprocity not just from the person they have donated to but from the community members who have observed their donating behavior. For this, a typical trust game may be inefficient. We implore proxying reciprocity with the expectations donors have when giving. We, therefore, use an expected reciprocity measure in a hybrid dictator game. Before subjects receive a donation from a dictator, they are asked what they expect to be the donation. This is the measure we use to estimate/proxy reciprocity.
Treatment arms, randomization and Statistical specification i. Stage 1: Set up and empathy inducement
• The sample is randomized to empathy treatment using the perspective-taking task. The treatment group is also primed by a vignette about a member of a community experiencing a medical condition that requires a substantial amount of money in hospital bills. Further, a brief profile of their local dependency ratio (children, spouse and general household needs) is provided. After reading through the textual vignette, the treatment group writes three words about the member’s feeling and how their decision to share some resources/money would affect her. The control group chose between a collage of pictures depicting different weather conditions and then write three statements about yesterday's weather in the morning, afternoon and in the evening.

ii. Stage 2: Success of the empathy manipulation.

• Subjects are presented with three lexicons (words) describing empathetic feelings. To ensure continuous elicitation of feelings, we assume a slider version of the scale running from 0 to 100. Participants slide the cursor to a point in which they feel empathetic, concerned and sad. There shall be an example (with unrelated question) on how to use the slider before the actual survey questions:

EmpAvscore = α1 + β1Treatmentemp + ε

iii. Observability

• A full cross randomization is implemented. Half of the subjects are treated to full observability. That is, they are told that their donation behavior will be made public to their paired subject in the room before their round of play. The second round players’ behavior is not observed.

iv. Effects of empathy

• The donation game proceeds as usual. All subjects are told that they will participate in two games. In the first game (dictator game), they will receive 50 shillings from the experimenter. They will be asked to donate some, all or none of the resources to Player B. They are also made aware that there shall be another round of play for which they will be receivers. The study estimates;
Donationsavg =α2+β1Treatemp+β2Treatemp∗Treatinf +ε

v. Stage 4: Reputation

• Following the information randomization, half of the players are concerned about observability of their behavior. Hence to capture this hypothesis, the study shall seek to estimate:

Donationsavg =α3+β1Treatinf +β2Treatemp∗Treatinf +ε

vi. Stage 4: Exptected Reciprocity.

To estimate, even momentarily, whether individuals could be seen to care about reciprocity in charitable giving, we assume a novel approach to the experimental variant of a trust game. 

Formally, reciprocity as measured within a trust game is such that player A interacts with player B in gift exchange. Having been given equal endowments, Player A allocates positive resources to player B for which the experimenter multiplies the donation by a factor (usually 3) before player B receives it. Player B then makes a decision about how much he wants to send back to Player A. The amount sent back is potentially the measure of reciprocity.

However, while giving within welfare groups, individuals who are concerned about reciprocity know that reciprocity is not tied to the exact individual they are now donating to. That is, donating to player B is not limited to his position to reciprocate but extends to other group members. It is also often not tied to the cause3 of the “now” donation but has effects on other forms of occurrences that may require donation.

This confound potentially renders a typical trust game weak in identifying the preferences. We then propose to use a retrospective self-reported measure. That is we inform the subjects that whatever they donated to player B got tripled by the experimenter. Also, they are told that Player C could reciprocate their donations of upto three times what they donated. They are then asked to indicate how much they would expect player C to send back.",,Randomization is done by a computer programme and at the play-off laboratory.,individual,0,450,225 treatment and 225 control,,"Name: University of Witwatersrand

Previous work has relied on observational evidence from settings such as transportation or employment decisions to bound individuals' price elasticity of demand for reductions in mortality risk. These approaches assume that individuals have unbiased information about mortality risk, and then use objectively measured risks to estimate demand models. This study first aims to investigate the possibility that individuals have systematically biased beliefs about risk. Second, we aim to generate experimental variation to estimate VSL. We plan to implement this experiment in the context of demand for motorcycle helmets. ",,,,2022-10-31,2023-03-15,,The primary outcome is the value of a statistical life (VSL). ,,"Semi-elasticity of demand for helmet with respect to information, price elasticity of demand for helmets, and the reduced form effect of each treatment assignment on helmet demand.",,"I plan to conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment that will consist of one survey lasting 15-45 minutes. Respondents will be given randomized information about motorcycle safety, and then all treatment groups will participate in a willingness to accept exercise to measure valuations for motorcycle helmets.","This study will consist of a single survey that will take between 15 and 45 minutes. A primary focus of the survey is to measure beliefs about the mortality risk of taking motorcycle taxis and the effectiveness of motorcycle helmets at preventing death. The study is a lab-in-the-field experiment in which respondents will receive randomly varying information about the safety risks of motorcycle taxis and helmet effectiveness. They will then participate in a Becker–DeGroot–Marschak (BDM) willingness to accept game to measure their valuations of motorcycle helmets. The goal of this experiment is to estimate how beliefs about safety affect helmet demand, which in turn can be used to estimate the value of a statistical life (VSL).

Respondents will be recruited at motorcycle taxi stands in Nairobi. Surveyors will interview respondents throughout the day, although traffic is generally higher during morning and evening commutes. We expect that many potential respondents will be time constrained and thus aim to minimize the duration of the survey. Surveyors will visit multiple stands throughout the city in order to reach a broader sample of passengers. 

Data collection will consist of 1 to 2 weeks of piloting followed by roughly six weeks of data collection. The goal of the pilot phase is to refine the survey questions and resolve any issues with the survey instrument before beginning data collection. In particular, the processing of measuring beliefs about one's mortality risk is likely to pose challenges. A focus of the pilot is in refining the set of questions used to measure these perceptions and the wording of questions. 

Data will be collected using SurveyCTO. Randomization will be conducted in SurveyCTO using the random() function. This function uses the Java randomization algorithm to take a pseudo-random draw from a standard uniform distribution. This study does not stratify randomization since the sample is not known en-ante. Hence, randomization must be conducted in the survey. Independent random draws are used to determine which information treatment group the respondent is assigned to and which price offering the respondent receives in the BDM demand exercise. Since a primary focus of this study is estimating the value of a statistical life, which requires data on individuals mortality beliefs, respondents are assigned to the pure control with a lower probability (10% vs 30%). We plan to offer respondents a cash payment between Kenyan shillings (Ksh) 5 and 600 with uniform probability. 

The first information treatment group is a pure control. These respondents will be asked a series of demographic questions and basic information about motorcycle ridership, then proceed to the willingness to accept exercise. Those assigned to the pure control will not be asked any questions about their perceived likelihood of dying in a motorcycle accident, or other questions relating to motorcycle safety. The aim of the pure control group is to provide an estimate of baseline demand for motorcycle helmets among consumers that are not asked to think carefully about safety before being offered a helmet. 

The control group and treatment groups will be asked detailed questions about their perceptions about motorcycle safety. Prior to the pilot, we do not plan to offer any information about mortality risk or helmet effectiveness to those in the control group. However, we may present those in the control group with data about the respondent's empirical accident risk depending on responses during the baseline. If respondents have extremely diffuse priors about empirical mortality risk, then noise in the measurement of perceptions about accident risks may dramatically reduce the power of this study. In this case, we may present the control group with empirical accident risk data so that the primary variation generated by the study will enter through beliefs about helmet effectiveness which are well-studied, more heavily publicized, and easier to understand. 

Empirical risks are calculated using the 2021 mortality risk per motorcycle trip of motorcycle drivers, since we know that one driver is present during each trip but were not able to obtain high quality estimates about the frequency of trips that involve a passenger, calculated using data from news sources and the Kenyan National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA). We then use the per-trip risk of an average Kenyan and the respondent's ridership volume to estimate their mortality risk over a 5-year span, the recommended lifespan of the helmet. 

We currently plan to present both treatment groups with the empirical mortality risk estimates. However, if respondents are able to articulate well-measured priors that exceed the empirical estimates, we may remove the empirical estimates from the survey instrument. There are two reasons for this. First, the empirical estimates are poorly measured due to data constraints, so we do not want to present respondents with information that may make them less likely to engage in safety precautions if they have well-formed priors. Second, we think it is likely that individuals under-estimate helmet efficacy given extremely low use. Revising beliefs about mortality risk down and helmet effectiveness up would generate an ambiguous change in the perceived mortality risk reduction from a helmet, dramatically reducing power. 

Both treatment groups will receive information about helmet effectiveness. The first treatment group will be presented with the results of Liu et al. (2008) which conducts a meta-analysis of studies on helmet effectiveness, predominately from developed contexts, and estimates that helmets reduce mortality risk by 42%. Those in the second treatment group will be presented with the finding from Ouellet and Kasantikul (2006) that helmets in Thailand reduced mortality risk by roughly 70% when properly worn. 

After completing the information treatment, all arms will engage in a BDM willingness to accept game in which they are asked to state the smallest cash payment they would prefer to a free helmet. A cash payment will then be drawn at random, and respondents will receive the cash if it is at least as large as their bid and otherwise be given the free helmet. 

A lack of credible data on beliefs about helmet effectiveness and helmet demand made conducting power calculations difficult. In addition, the primary goal of the treatment is to generate a strong instrument, not detect a treatment effect. Hence, we plan to survey the maximum number of people possible with the budget available for this pilot. We expect the number of surveys to be around 1,000-2,000. If this sample is sufficient, data collection will end. If not, we will collect more data in a second wave and pool the samples, including wave fixed effects in regressions.

This project’s interventions offer capital support to the aspiring micro-entrepreneurs, and for a random subsample, a mentoring program. The mentoring program aims to improve economic outcomes, but also social outcomes–the mentee’s confidence, social attitudes, and well-being. For the mentor-mentee combinations featuring mixed gender or refugee-host mentor-mentee pairings, we also test for social cohesion improvement–increased economic interactions across identity groups outside of the mentorship context, and improved attitudes toward refugees and women, and toward policies aimed at improving those groups’ welfare. 

Previous laboratory and field experiments suggest that perspective-sharing, i.e. hearing directly from the other about their perspective and experience, leads to improved attitudes toward and increased support for policies related to minoritized populations. The mentoring intervention uses this psychological insight and is randomly administered to half of the mentoring pairs. We examine any added effect of  perspective-sharing informed mentorship in business mentorship pairs on economic, psychological, and social cohesion outcomes. 

First, we construct cohorts based on geographical proximity. Then, by cohort, stratifying on gender and country of origin, we randomly assign aspiring micro-entrepreneurs to one of four research arms: (i) a control group, which will receive treatment after completion of the study; (ii) business grant only; (iii) business grant and mentorship; (iv) business grant and mentorship with perspective-sharing. Participants in the active treatment arms receive a  business grant one month after the start of the program. Participants in the mentorship treatment arms engage in nine pairwise meetings between aspiring and more established micro-entrepreneurs over the course of two and a half months. These meetings are centered around either just economic/business content or economic/business content and perspective-sharing, i.e. building a shared understanding of one another's experiences and circumstances, between the mentor and the mentee. We examine whether mentorship acts as a complement to the business grant, thereby improving economic and psychological outcomes, and whether these effects are more pronounced for those in the perspective-sharing informed mentorship research arm. 

Taking into consideration geographical proximity, gender, and industry of interest, aspiring micro-entrepreneurs in groups  (iii) and (iv) are randomly matched with eligible mentors.

By cohort, stratifying on gender, recruited mentors are similarly randomly assigned to one of three research arms: (i) control; (ii) mentorship; and, (iii) mentorship with perspective-sharing. We then randomly specify aligned vs. misaligned nationality/residency status mentee matches for mentors assigned to groups (ii) and (iii). For mentors, we examine whether perspective-sharing fosters greater interpersonal cohesion and whether this translates into improved social and political attitudes towards refugees and women for misaligned matches. We further examine whether misaligned matches play a role in expanding and diversifying the mentors’ business interactions and networks. Across both populations, we measure outcomes 1, 3, 6, and 9 months after the first meeting. 

",,,,2022-09-06,2023-03-31,"Aspiring micro-entrepreneurs: All participants in the active treatment arms receive a business grant one month after the start of the intervention. This business grant is labeled for business and participants are encouraged to use it for this purpose. Participants in the mentorship treatment arms engage in nine weekly 1:1 meetings with their mentors. The aspiring micro-entrepreneurs are provided a transport allowance to cover the costs of travel associated with these meetings and an allowance for internet usage. Across both the mentorship research arms, the 1:1 meetings focus on covering some business content based on material (videos and handouts) shared with all participants by the implementation partner, the International Rescue Committee (IRC). The remainder of the meeting can be used for observation, sharing business experience or answering questions that the mentee raises. The mentorship with perspective sharing includes a difference based perspective sharing exercise during the introductory meeting between the mentor and the mentee where the mentor raises several questions for both of them to answer and share their unique experiences. This exercise is intended to help build trust and a shared understanding of circumstances between the mentor and the mentee as they start their relationship. Each subsequent meeting includes a reinforcement perspective-sharing exercise before the mentor launches into the business content. The control group receives services from the IRC after the end of the intervention.

Mentors: All mentors in the active treatment arms receive a half day training. Across both the mentorship treatment arms, the training includes information (expectations, compensation, reporting concerns, etc) about engaging with the implementation partner, the IRC, and an introduction to the business content, including videos and handouts. Mentors assigned to the mentorship with perspective-sharing treatment arm receive additional training on non-judgmental active listening and on truly hearing and understanding the experiences and circumstances of their mentees and tailoring their advice according to their needs and circumstances. All mentors are expected to participate in nine 1:1 meetings with their mentees over the course of two and a half months. Mentors receive a fixed stipend per meeting, as well as an allowance for internet and transport for the training day.

Yet agricultural productivity remains far below its potential in many Sub-Saharan African countries. Our project investigates whether an innovative approach to provide technical information, consisting of agri-edutainment (educational entertainment) programs broadcasted on national television, can help to meet the informational needs of farmers. Two key distinguishing features of TV programs are that (i) they can easily convey information also to populations with relatively low literacy levels, and (ii) they are easy to distribute at scale at low marginal cost compared to traditional extension services. TV may also be a particularly useful medium to mitigate gender gaps in access and effectiveness of traditional extension services, to the extent that TV viewership is less gender-imbalanced than access to other services. Prior market research in Kenya indicates that a “makeover style” reality television show focused on farming as business helped to boost farmer incomes at a cost of only $0.50 per viewer. We leverage the planned rollout of this television program to Uganda (in 2022/23) to measure the causal impact and cost-effectiveness of the show in diffusing recommended techniques, and to better understand the process of information transmission and learning in agriculture. ",,,,2022-03-22,2023-09-03,"We evaluate the national rollout of a “makeover style” reality television program in Uganda that focuses on farming as a business. The television program helps to guide small scale farmers on a range of agricultural topics in an engaging yet informative way. Examples of core topics include soil and water management, planting, and pest and disease management. Each week, the film crew visits a different farming family and encourages them to identify their key goals and challenges in crop and livestock production. The show emphasizes why there is a problem and how best to deal with it. Local experts are brought to the farm to provide customized support to the family and clearly demonstrate simple yet affordable ways in which the household can implement the recommended adjustments on their farm.

The intervention is designed to generate exogenous variation in viewership of the farming TV program among comparable groups of farmers. We encourage a (randomly selected) group of rural farmers to watch the farming show, and another (randomly selected) group to watch a competing show that is broadcast at the same time. We will also shed light on farmers’ learning and adoption processes by studying the role of information provided to urban and rural contacts of control group farmers.
","The primary outcomes for this study will be measured under five key domains:

0.	Take Up
•	The extent (0/1) and frequency of viewership of the targeted farming television program 

1.	Improved Knowledge of Agricultural Practices and Technologies
We will use multiple choice questions (with unambiguously correct answers) to measure the knowledge of plot managers under this domain, including: 
•	Theoretical knowledge of agricultural practices and technologies
•	Knowledge of specific practices and technologies recommended on the TV program 

2.	Changes in Production Practices and Agricultural Input Use.
We will measure the following choices made by plot managers under this domain:
•	The adoption (0/1) of agricultural practices and technologies that are common in the study region
•	The adoption (0/1) of agricultural practices and technologies specifically recommended on the TV program
•	Expenses incurred (UGX) on agricultural inputs in the reference farming season
•	The choice of crops grown, and farm animals reared 

3.	Farm Productivity, Revenues and Sales to Market. 
•	Production: Self-reported crop harvests in the reference agricultural season (volume)
•	Revenues: Value of crops harvested in the season, inclusive of production costs
•	Productivity: Crops harvested per unit of land area (volume and value)
•	Sales: Value of crops sold in unprocessed form (self-reported); average weekly income from the sales of processed crops and animal products; and crop sales as percentage of total output (commercialization).

4.	The Diffusion of Information and Financial Resources.
•	Flows of information on financing for agricultural purposes from (and to) social networks in rural areas and towns/cities.
",,"1.	Female Participation in Agricultural Decision-Making.
This will be measured using the identity of decision makers on each plot cultivated by the household. We also measure changes in the decision rights of these plot managers, e.g., to build structures on the plot, rent it out to someone else, plant tree crops, or use it as a loan security.   

2.	Changes in attitudes related to women’s participation in business. 
•	We will collect both explicit (self-reported) and implicit measures of attitudes toward women’s participation in business tasks. The implicit measures are based on implicit association tests that will be administered to respondents in our study sample.

3.	Changes in income and business aspirations.
•	Subjective expectations about revenues from farming in the next agricultural season
•	Farming goals (e.g., crop choice, livestock and area cultivated) in 5 years’ time
•	Professional or business goals in 5 years’ time
",,"Our project covers 10 districts in the Central Region of Uganda reached by the Luganda language broadcast of the farming TV show. We identify a population of farming households with access to TV and randomly assign them to one of the following experimental arms: (1) Watchers; (2) “non-Watchers” and, (3) Information Only. We use a symmetric encouragement design to minimize the possibility that ‘non-Watchers’ are directly exposed to episodes of the farming TV program. That is, households in group (1) are encouraged to watch the farming TV program, while households in group (2) are encouraged to watch a competing show that is broadcast on national television at the same time. The households in group (3) receive weekly farming tips that convey the same information as the farming show but through a different medium: mobile phones (with no entertainment or visual demonstration of steps for farmers to emulate).","The research methodology involves a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) at the household level with a symmetric encouragement design. The evaluation design is as follows:
1.	Draw sample of size N=3400 from population of active farmers with access to TV. All should be in the Central region of Uganda covered by the Luganda language broadcast.
2.	Identify for each sample farmer:
•	Up to 4 contacts who are also farmers in the same village or area who are the most important people the farmer refers to when making decisions about farming. These could be persons who the farmer is most likely to talk to about farming or who he/she is most likely to turn to for financial help.
•	Up to 4 urban contacts
3.	Classify households into network groups based on their baseline survey responses in Step 2 (i.e., no contacts reported, only rural contacts, only urban contacts, both contact types reported) 
4.	Randomize farmers into 3 groups (stratifying by gender, network group and subcounty):
▪	Control: incentivized to watch competing show using prize money (Group C)
▪	Intensive treatment: incentivized to watch the farming show using prize money (Group T1)
▪	Reminder treatment: SMS reminders to watch the farming show (Group T2) 
▪	Information treatment: provided the information content of the TV show through alternate ICT medium, i.e., SMS (Group T3)
5.	Randomize the Control farmers into 3 groups (stratifying by gender, network group, and subcounty): 
▪	Pure Control (Group CC)
▪	Urban link treated (Group CU): One urban link of the farmer is incentivized to watch the farming show using prize money. The link is chosen randomly from among urban contacts shared by the farmer.
▪	Rural link treated (Group CR): One rural link of the farmer is incentivized to watch the farming show using prize money. The link is chosen randomly from among rural contacts shared by the farmer.
The first randomization (4) is required to identify the direct effect of watching the farming TV program. The control group is encouraged not to watch (although of course they could). The intensive treatment group is designed to ensure that enough people in the sample watch to make it possible to see if there is an effect. The comparison in outcomes for farmers in group T1 vs those in group CC is the most powerful for detecting this basic impact. However, a potential concern is that farmers in group T1 may be watching the show differently than typical, because of the incentive. So group T2 is included because they are simply responding to a form of advertising.

The second randomization (5) is designed to detect spillover effects. Are farmers who are not themselves watching the TV program adopting some of the recommended practices? And is this more true for those for whom it is their urban or rural contacts who are watching? We plan to examine the impact of rural and urban contacts on control group farmers (groups CR and CU) both jointly and separately.

6612,Better Financing to Promote Access to Water and Improve Dairy Farming in Kenya,http://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/10426,"November 21, 2022",2022-11-21 09:10:15 -0500,2022-11-16,AEARCTR-0010426,10.1257/rct.10426-1.1,Kevin Carney kecarney@umich.edu,in_development,2022-11-14,2027-12-31,"[""agriculture"", ""finance""]",Private,Josh Deutschmann (jdeutschmann@uchicago.edu) University of Chicago; Michael  Kremer (kremermr@uchicago.edu) University of Chicago; Gautam Rao (grao@fas.harvard.edu) Harvard University,"G41, O13, O16, Q14",,"This project attempts to improve on existing lending models to finance the purchase of large agricultural assets. Jack et al. (2019) studied water tank loans offered to dairy farming households in central Kenya and found that allowing borrowers to collateralize their loans with the asset itself — rather than 100% with cash deposits by the borrower and guarantors — increased demand by 10-20 fold without meaningfully increasing default. In this project, we will test three potential ways to further increase access to finance for large agricultural assets. First, we will estimate the impacts of loan contract duration on demand and repayment. Given the durability of the water tanks, which have a 15-30 year lifespan, longer loan contracts might be socially optimal, allowing for manageable monthly payments for the poorest borrowers who otherwise couldn’t afford to take out a loan. However, the impact of offering such contracts on lender profits is ambiguous: longer loan contracts could decrease default by reducing the monthly payment amount, but they could also bring in more risky marginal borrowers or expose the lender to an increased risk of macroeconomic or climate shocks during the longer repayment period. Second, we will examine whether layaway plans, with scheduled monthly savings toward a water tank, improve the ability of farmers to obtain water tanks — many SACCOs in Kenya are capital constrained and can only finance a small number of loans. Layaway plans for large assets might help to increase adoption when local financial institutions can’t meet members’ demand for credit, and they may also be attractive to poor or debt-averse borrowers who are unable or unwilling to take out loans. Finally, we will test a novel contract combining commitment savings and credit, which allows members to save gradually in a layaway plan until they reach a minimum down payment and then transition to a loan whenever they choose; our design will allow us to measure the effects of reducing savings constraints while providing guaranteed access to future credit.",,,,2022-11-16,2027-01-31,"Our intervention is an offer of a financing product for a 5,000-liter Kentank rainwater harvesting tank. Approved, treated participants will be randomly offered one of the following contracts:

-A layaway savings plan: Members will be given a commitment savings account earning 5% non-compounding annual interest. Deposits will be deducted by default from their monthly payments for milk delivered to Nyala Dairy Multipurpose Cooperative Society (MPCS), our lender’s partner dairy cooperative. However, members will have the option to adjust or opt-out of these default deposits.  Members will receive their tanks once they have saved the full tank price plus a KSh 700 administration fee. Default deductions are planned to allow members to obtain their tanks in 2 years, however they will be allowed up to three years to save the full amount. Members who fail to save the full tank price within 3 years or choose to withdraw will have their money refunded to their SACCO account, minus the KSh 700 administration fee. Interest will be paid at the end of the contract only to members who have saved the full amount within the allotted time.

-2-year and 3-year asset-collateralized loans (ACL): Members will be required to pay an administration fee of KSh 700 and to make a down payment of 1/6th of the total tank price. They will then receive their tanks and be issued a loan for the remaining balance, with mandatory monthly payments of 1/24th or 1/36th of the principal plus 6.5% annual interest on the full principal. Like in the layaway contract, monthly payments will be automatically deducted from milk payments from Nyala Dairy MPCS, which may be supplemented by cash payments. If a borrower defaults on their repayments, Nyala Vision SACCO will repossess the tank and refund the borrower’s money, minus the cost of repossession and resale and the KSh 700 administration fee.

-A hybrid layaway-ACL contract: Members will be offered a layaway savings plan. They will be allowed to switch to an ACL (with monthly payments equivalent to the 2-year ACL above) and receive their tanks any time after they have saved the KSh 700 administration fee and down payment of 1/6th of the tank price, as long as they are on track to complete their contract within 3 years.
The price will include the tank and tap as well as delivery to the farmer’s home.
","-Willingness-to-pay for each water tank financing contract (KSh)
-Obtained a new large (>= 5,000 L) water tank: (1) From Nyala; (2) From any source","Estimated per-contract SACCO profits will be calculated as revenues (such as interest payments to the SACCO, the KSh 700 administration fee, and price markups) minus costs (such as staff time for loan marketing, registration and administration, the cost of tank repossession and resale, and interest owed on savings deposits). The exact construction of this variable will be informed by observation of SACCO operations and interviews with staff. ","Detailed repayment indicators:
-Tank repossessed
-Ever late on a monthly payment
-Received a pending default letter
-Down payment reclaimed
-Failed to complete full repayment by end of contract period
-Total amount outstanding at end of contract period
-Months late to complete repayment
-Repaid early
-Months early

Water storage and usage:
-Number of water tanks owned
-Total water storage capacity
-Piped water usage (meter readings)

Real impacts on dairy production:
-Self-reported daily milk production
-Monthly milk sales to Nyala Dairy MPCS
-At least one cow got sick
-Estimated per-contract SACCO profits
",,"Sampling: Our sample will consist of dairy farmers who delivered an average of 25 - 2,000 kgs of milk per month to Nyala Dairy from January to March, 2022. This results in a sample of 9,203 dairy members, 72% of all active Nyala producers over the period. We remove members with average monthly milk deliveries less than 25 kgs because this is the approximate amount necessary to pay the full tank price within three years using milk earnings alone. We further remove large producers and producers that are evidently not households (e.g. schools) to focus our analysis on smallholder farming households.

Randomization: Members will be randomized into 5 main treatment arms: Control (12.5%), Layaway (12.5%), 2-year ACL (25%), 3-year ACL (25%), and Hybrid (25%). The price of the water tank offered to each member will also be randomly assigned. Both randomizations will be stratified by the nearest Nyala Vision SACCO branch and milk production quartile.

Baseline Survey: Eligible dairy farmers will then be approached for a baseline survey, which will be conducted either at their homes. The survey will collect information on demographics, farming practices and milk production, asset ownership, water access and storage, time use, health outcomes, and social groups. At the end of the survey, treated farmers will be given information on the terms of the four possible contracts and told that they may be offered a discount. They will be invited to visit their local SACCO branch within the three months to register for a contract. Members will not be told at this stage which contract or price they will be offered.

Loan Approval: The research team will share the ID numbers of all members interested in purchasing a water tank with Nyala Vision SACCO. Nyala will not be informed of the treatment status or given any individual-level survey data. Nyala will then choose whether or not to approve each member for a two-year loan contract. Approved members will be our main sample for this analysis.

Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) Elicitation: When approved members visit the SACCO branch to register for a contract, a surveyor will administer a Becker, DeGroot and Marschak (1964) preference elicitation. Farmers will be asked if they would like to take out each contract at various prices, ranging from the retail price down to zero. Then, the surveyor will then reveal the true randomly selected contract offer and price. If the farmer’s stated willingness-to-pay for the randomly-assigned contract was as least as high as the price drawn, the farmer will be given the contract for that price. Otherwise, the farmer will not be given a financing contract. Until the price is revealed, neither the potential borrower nor the surveyor will know the contract or price assigned.

Administration: Nyala Vision SACCO will administer contracts to those who took them out during the BDM elicitation, and they will collect administrative data on repayment that will be used as outcome data. During tank installation, a subset of households connected to piped water will be fitted with a water meter, which will collect data on piped water usage.

Endline Survey: IPA will collect an endline survey to gather data on outcomes including water tank ownership, storage capacity, milk production, and related outcomes.
","Prices will be randomly drawn from the following distribution:
-Wholesale price minus KSh 100 (KSh 39,900): 11.67%
-Wholesale price (KSh 34,000): 11.67%
-Wholesale price plus KSh 100 (KSh 34,100): 11.67%
-Retail price minus KSh 100 (KSh 35,500): 22.5%
-Retail price (KSh 35,600): 22.5%
-All other multiples of KSh 100 between KSh 31,200 and KSh 35,600: 0.475%
-All multiples of KSh between prices between 0 and KSh 31,200: 1% chance of a price being drawn from this range, with prices in the range drawn uniformly (0.003% for each price in this range).

This distribution was chosen to:
-Place most of the mass near the wholesale and retail prices to maximize power for analysis of comparing repayment outcomes at wholesale and retail prices;
-Slightly oversample higher prices, where we anticipate lower take-up, to increase power in this ex post analysis;
Maintain incentive compatibility for the BDM elicitation across a wide range of prices;
-Reduce the surveyors’ ability to influence respondents’ reported willingness-to-pay by placing increased mass within a KSh 100 interval around the wholesale and retail prices, rather than on these prices only.

For ethical reasons, we will not sample any prices higher than Nyala Vision SACCO’s previous retail price of KSh 35,600. The surveyors and respondents will not be informed of the distribution of prices.

In emerging markets, business digitization can be a key strategy for firms to increase wealth.

In our randomized control trial (RCT) we investigate how access to and knowledge of digital tools and technology can impact both firm performance outcomes and access to financial services. While technology has great potential in creating and managing wealth, many small-scale entrepreneurs in developing countries lack hands-on knowledge of how to leverage them for growth. This lack of ‘digital capital’ can be a significant constraint to growth in today’s digitized society. Our research aims to shed light on this problem by examining the effectiveness of a novel digital skills intervention, which combines 1) practical in-class training of business digitization, and 2) in-depth follow-up technical assistance on digital tools.

",,2023-07-01,2023-10-31,"This study uses a randomized control trial to investigate the impact of urban farming and using black soldier fly frass fertilizer (BSFFF) from recycled household waste for urban farming on food and nutrition security. The proposed interventions include two treatments: (1) multi-storey gardens (MSG) for planting vegetables including starter material and training on how to use (T1), and (2) MSG combined with BSFFF from recycled household waste, including starter material and training on use (T2). ","The outcomes of interest include the household’s dietary diversity score measured as the number of food groups consumed by a household out of 12 food groups seven days before the survey; food security, per capita food consumption expenditure; income, measured as the total household consumption expenditure; and household crop production",,"Gendered effects of the intervention, labor supply, and time devoted to home production of food",,"Randomization will be performed at the enumeration area level because MSGs are relatively large and can serve several households. First, we identify all N enumeration areas within 15 villages in Kibera. We will randomly divide a sample of M (< N) enumeration areas into three. M/3 enumeration areas will receive MSG (group 1), M/3 enumeration areas will receive MSG and FF (group 2), and the remaining M/3 will be the comparison group (group 3). We will administer surveys to assess whether treatment and control groups have similar characteristics. We will implement MSG in every household in a treatment enumeration area (groups 1 and 2) and BSFFF will be available for use by all households within the treated enumeration area (group 2). ","Randomization will be performed at the enumeration area level because MSGs are relatively large and can serve several households. First, we identify all N enumeration areas within 15 villages in Kibera. We will randomly divide a sample of M (< N) enumeration areas into three. M/3 enumeration areas will receive MSG (group 1), M/3 enumeration areas will receive MSG and FF (group 2), and the remaining M/3 will be the comparison group (group 3). We will administer surveys to assess whether treatment and control groups have similar characteristics. We will implement MSG in every household in a treatment enumeration area (groups 1 and 2) and BSFFF will be available for use by all households within the treated enumeration area (group 2). 

Within treatment enumeration areas, we will offer the chance of every household installing MSG to grow their own vegetables. Some households might refuse treatment, in which case, they will not have access to MSG and will not be able to grow their own crops. 
Randomization of MSG across enumeration areas allows estimation of the overall effect of MSG on dietary and economic outcomes by comparing treatment and control enumeration areas, even in the presence of within-enumeration area externalities. See, for instance, Duflo and Saez (2002), Miguel and Kremer (2002; 2004). This is the intention-to-treat approach. 

The question is whether we can decompose the effect for treatment enumeration areas into a direct effect on treated household and an externality effect on untreated households within treated enumeration areas. This would allow us to get at the effect on treated. The assignment to treatment may be used as an instrumental variable for actual compliance provided that the exclusion restriction applies: changes in dietary and economic outcomes depend on having MSG alone, though not in being given the option of adopting MSG. If externalities are deemed important (because treated households share food with non-treated households, for instance) we will have to understand what explains selection into the program (socioeconomic characteristics, departing dietary outcomes, etc.), so that we can determine a suitable instrumental variable to correct for self-selection. We will also ask that people list people in their network to control for network intersection.  Again, randomization of BSFFF across enumeration areas allows estimation of the overall effect of MSG on dietary and economic outcomes by comparing treatment and control enumeration areas. 

The implementation of BSFFF will have to be such that those who refused MSG do not have access to frass fertilizer since it will be applied to random MSGs. If this implementation correction is cared for, the same reasoning for the correction of self-selection in MSG alone applies. 
We will be able to identity cross- enumeration area externalities (the impact of MSG and BSFFF for households in enumeration areas located near treatment enumeration area) using exogenous variation in the local density of treatment enumeration households generated by the enumeration area-level randomization. ",Done in office by a computer.,Enumeration areas,150 enumeration areas including 5-10 households,900 households,"50 enumeration areas control, 50 enumeration areas with multi-storey gardens only and 50 enumeration areas with multi-storey gardens and frass fertilizer.","Based on a conservative power calculation, a sample size of 900 households will be used in this study with 600 household being assigned to the treatments (300 in T1 - multi-storey gardens and 300 in T2 - BSFFF) and 300 households being assigned to the control group. The power calculation assumes a 5 percent level of statistical significance and a statistical power of 80 percent. The power calculation further assumes a monthly per adult equivalent food expenditure of KShs. 5705. This benchmark value for the outcome indicator is from the 2015/16 Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey.

Therefore, if consumers believe it is very unlikely to find sellers that offer high-quality goods, this type of markets may break down. Consequently, a change in consumer beliefs can boost demand for experience goods. In this paper, we experimentally test if a shock to consumer beliefs, namely the entry of a quality-conscious seller into the market, can boost demand for an experience good. We conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment with farmers in Western Kenya, where we recreate an agricultural input market. Specifically, participants choose between two types of goods: one with fixed quality and another one with varying quality, which is unknown ex-ante. Some randomly selected respondents also have the chance to select the varying-quality good from two types of distributions, which respondents partially know. One of those quality distributions, which represents the quality-conscious entrant seller, has a smaller mean and variance than the incumbent distribution. Additionally, we elicit respondents' beliefs about the quality distributions to test whether the effect of entry on demand depends on consumer beliefs rather than the true quality distribution of the experience good in the market. Finally, we elicit participants willingness-to-pay for the different goods offered throughout the game to observe if their valuation varies depending on the quality distribution they face.",,,,2023-03-09,2023-04-01,,"Our main outcomes of interest are

- We obtain the respondents' demand for the experience good from the market game. Specifically, we record whether the participant choose the experience good (i.e., seeds) over the alternative good in each one of the rounds of the game.
- We obtain respondents' valuation of the experience good from the willingness-to-pay exercise. We will compute the ratio of the entrant's good WTP to the incumbent's good WTP.",,,"1. Market game:
Participants play for 20 rounds. In each round, respondents choose between hybrid maize seeds sold by a hypothetical incumbent store and an alternative good. We assume the quality of maize seeds is not fixed, for that reason, the amount of high-quality seeds that they might receive varies in each round. To achieve this in the experiment, participants choosing seeds take out 10 marbles out of a bag that we denote as the incumbent's bag. Participants can trade each black marble that they take out for 100 grams of hybrid maize seeds of their preferred variety with a germination rate above 90%. Participants face two different incumbent stores during the experiment; one in the first 10 rounds and a different one for the second 10. Each incumbent store has a different quality distribution. In particular, we consider four different quality distributions:
- High-quality and high-dispersion (HQ/HD): 80 black and 20 white marbles
- High-quality and low-dispersion (HQ/LD): 16 black and 4 white marbles
- Low-quality and high-dispersion (LQ/HD): 60 black and 40 white marbles
- Low-quality and low-dispersion (LQ/LD): 12 black and 8 white marbles.

Each session is randomly assigned to a pair of distributions before starting the game. In each round, participants have the chance to choose an alternative good instead of hybrid maize seeds. Before we start the game, respondents choose between 3 kg of maize flour, 1 liter of cooking oil, and 2 kg of sugar as the alternative good for all 20 rounds. The quantities chosen are monetary similar to 1 kg of hybrid maize seeds by March 2023. In order to inform participants about the quality distributions they will face during the game, we take 10 draws out of each incumbent's bag before round 1 and 11 and write them down in a whiteboard visible to all respondents.

After rounds 5 and 15, we conduct an exercise to elicit participants' beliefs about the incumbent's quality distribution. We ask respondents to imagine they will play the game for an additional 20 rounds, and each time they will choose seeds over the alternative good. We then ask them how many white marbles they believe they would take out each time. We provide participants with a chart with 20 boxes on it, each one representing these hypothetical rounds of the game. We instruct respondents to place some beans in each box depending on how many white marbles they believe they would take each time. 

To observe the consumers' reaction to the entry of a quality-conscious seller, we add a new bag to the choice set of some participants that are randomly selected after round 5 and 15. This new bag which represents the entrant store has a quality distribution with higher mean and lower variance than the incumbent store. In particular, this new bag has 18 black and 2 white marbles. In case selected participants choose maize seeds over the alternative good, they can decide to take marbles out from the incumbent's or the entrant's bag. Finally, we incentive the game by giving to participants the good they chose in a randomly selected round.

2. Willingness-to-pay elicitation:
After we conclude the market game, we conduct an exercise to elicit participants' willingness-to-pay for six different goods:
- Bag of maize seeds sold by the incumbent store of the first 10 rounds
- Bag of maize seeds sold by the incumbent store of the second 10 rounds
- Bag of maize seeds sold by the entrant store
- 1 kg of maize seeds with a germination rate between 90 and 95%
- 1 kg of maize seeds with a germination rate above 95%
- The alternative good selected by the participant at the beginning of the game.
For the first three items, we ask participants to take 10 marbles out of each bag and put them in separate smaller bags that we seal. We reveal the content of the bags after we have concluded the exercise.

We conduct a multiple price list approach to elicit respondents' WTP. For each item, we ask participants whether they are willing to buy the good at different prices. We offer the items at prices ranging between 0 and 300 KES. To check for inconsistent choices in the form of single- or multiple-switching behavior, we offer the good at all prices in the list (Jack et al., 2022). In addition, we also randomize the order in which the choices are presented to respondents to take into account any framing effect on the participants' valuations. Specifically, we randomize whether we start asking a participant the question with the smallest price and then continue in ascending order, or we begin with the biggest price and then proceed in descending order.

To incentivize participants to reveal their true WTP, we inform them that we will randomly select one price from the list. If at the selected price, the participant expressed to be willing to purchase the good, then she buys it at that price. Conversely, if the participant stated she is not willing to buy the item at the selected price, then she will not be able to purchase it. To increase power, we elicit WTP for all six items but only incentivize one of them, which is randomly selected. In other words, we randomly select one good and then they draw the price. Finally, participants receive 500 KES for their participation in the experiment. They use this money to pay for the good chosen in case they purchase it.

3. Survey
After concluding the experiment, we administer a survey to each participant to collect data on their previous experience with One Acre Fund and agricultural input purchasing decisions for the last year. In addition, we ask about their perception of input quality of their local market and quality check practices that they may have when purchasing inputs. Finally, we administer a module on risk and time preferences with questions taken from the Global Preferences Survey (Falk et al., 2018).",,"Randomization into incumbent's quality distribution and entry treatment occurs in the field, before enumerators recruit participants for a session.","Randomization into incumbent's quality distribution occurs at the session level (i.e., groups of five participants), whereas randomization into the entry treatment occurs at the individual level.","63 sessions of five participants (i.e., three sessions in 21 market centers).",315 farmers.,158 farmers assign to the treatment group (entry) and 157 to the control group,"We are powered to detect an increase in the odds ratio of 2.22 for participants experiencing entry in a market where the incumbent has low average quality.

In sub-Saharan Africa, drought is a main cause of livestock losses and has been shown to drive pastoral households into poverty, and in some cases, trap them there. Insurance is a promising financial tool that is used in many agricultural settings to mitigate the impacts of drought but had not been available to most pastoralists because these had yet to be a cost-effective model for offering it. The Index Based Livestock Insurance (IBLI) product was piloted in northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia starting in 2010 and 2012, respectively. Since then, the product has grown in scale, offering access to formal insurance coverage to millions of pastoralists. Consistent with the literature on insurance coverage, studies of the pilots have shown that IBLI coverage benefits clients in several ways, but there have been no studies on the long-term impacts of access to IBLI. In this study, we aim to determine the impacts that IBLI has had on its clients over the 10 + years that is has been available in the Horn of Africa. Specifically, we will test if the impacts identified during project activities in the study region between 2010 and 2015 have persisted. Our empirical approach to causal identification relies on variation in IBLI purchases caused by an intervention that was both randomized at the household level and increased IBLI uptake during the pilot period. 
",,,,2010-01-01,2015-09-30,"The Index Based Livestock Insurance (IBLI) product is a commercial insurance product that makes insurance payouts based on remotely sensed NDVI data.  The product is sold during two sales windows each year and provides coverage for 12 months, which containes two potential payout periods. This study tests for the long-term impacts of IBLI. ","Herd size and composition
Total household income
Maximum years of education within a household","Herd size is measured by the total number of animals a household herds, and the number of animals a household owns. We aggregate across animal types by cattle market-value equivalent.3 We construct variables of herd composition – represented by the share of the value each animal type among the total value of livestock holding.

Total household income is examined as a measure of material well-being of the household. We construct this measure by aggregating the income of a household from various income sources over the year. We winsorize the value at the 99th percentile to address the effect of extreme values. For comparability, US dollar is used as a currency.

Human capital accumulation is a long-term outcome. If a household changed investments in human capital due to IBLI uptake, it could have an impact on the maximum years of education. We collected information of highest level of education completed by each household member, so we take the maximum of it to construct the variable.","Herd management expenditure
Annual milk income per livestock market-value equivalent
Livestock loss
Distress sales of livestock (in response to indemnity payments)
Share of children working full-time, part-time, and studying fulltime
IBLI uptake in the past 12 months","Herd management expenditure is an important indicator of pastoral investment of a household. To measure this, we calculate the total annual expenditure on water, fodder, supplementary feeding, and veterinary expenses.

We use milk income per livestock market-value equivalent as a measure of productivity of livestock herding. IBLI was found to increase milk income per livestock market-value equivalent in the short-term. We aggregate the income per each animal unit from the milk sales throughout four sales seasons. For comparability, US dollar is used as a currency.

Information on the number of animals lost due to various reasons (e.g., drought, diseases, livestock raid) was collected in the survey. We create a measure at the animal type, referring to the number of losses per animal type, as well as an aggregate measure by their market values using the pooled average prices observed from all purchases and all sold animals.

This variable is constructed by the number of animals sold to cope with droughts. We aggregate the number of animals across different types by their market values using the pooled average prices observed from all purchases and all sold animals.

Children play important role in a household’s livestock production. A previous study finds that IBLI increases children’s participation in full-time schooling while decreasing part-time work. Using information on children’s primary and secondary activities over the 12 month periods, we construct children’s activity status ranging from full-time work, part-time work and schooling, and full-time schooling.

IBLI uptake is recorded for all sample households in each type of animal – camels, cows, goats, and sheep. We examine both the extensive margin of whether or not the household purchased any IBLI policy, as well as the intensive margin corresponding to the number of animals insured of each type in Tropical Livestock Units (TLU)
","The original research design distributed discount coupons for insurance premium  randomly within each community (sublocation in Kenya, kebele in Ethiopia) each sales season. Details of this intervention are specified in Jensen, Barrett, and Mude (2017) for Kenya and Matsuda, Takahashi, and Ikegami (2019) for Ethiopia, respectively.

In addition to the discount coupons, interventions to transfer knowledge about the IBLI product were offered in both countries. In Kenya, a selected subsample of communities played IBLI knowledge games designed to illustrate key features of IBLI products. In Ethiopia, learning kits – including skit tapes and cartoons – were provided to randomly chosen subset of the communities. We do not explore the effect of these interventions in our analysis since the immediate effect of these interventions on insurance uptake were shown to be minimal (Jensen, Mude, and Barrett, 2018; Takahashi et al., 2016).",,Stratified randomization done by computer.,Treatments were randomized among participants within sublocation in Kenya and within kebele in Ethiopia.

Women within these households often bear a disproportionate share of that risk, with their assets and even their own food consumption being the first things sacrificed as households cope with the devastation of drought. While there has been innovation of insurance contracts for this region (index-based livestock insurance, or IBLI), uptake remains low in part because the contracts have been built around what are culturally typed in the area as male activities, and in part because of the high upfront cost of a product that can only be purchased during a short sales window at the beginning of each rainy season. The purpose of this research is to learn how to make IBLI fully available to women so that they may benefit from it. We will focus on women who are currently members of a savings group, the ubiquitous social support structures that encourage members to save and invest while often also providing informal insurance against idiosyncratic shocks. Taking a sample of nearly 6,500 women belonging to 410 distinct savings groups located across 5 counties in northeastern Kenya, we will implement a randomized controlled trial to measure the effect on insurance uptake and subsequent asset protection of: i) reshaping the existing IBLI contract so that it speaks directly to the risks and needs that are most central to women, and ii) promoting the adoption of a ‘village insurance savings (VISA) account’ within each treated savings group as a way for women to save money in advance for insurance purchases.",,,,2023-03-06,2023-09-30,"We will implement a randomized controlled trial measuring the impact of a two-pronged intervention that:

• Provides insurance education to women and promotes the use of their savings group as a way to save money in advance for insurance purchases through what we call a village insurance savings (VISA) account. These accounts will be essentially an accounting device in which members of a savings group publicly contribute monthly sums of money into a common account with the explicit objective of saving enough funds to purchase insurance at a future time period. As with all contributions held by savings groups, all funds are held in a locked box by the group’s treasurer in a publicly known location. Withdrawal of these funds at any point of time will be allowed and the decision to purchase insurance with the accumulated savings will always remain voluntary. 

• Reframes the current IBLI contract as a product that can be used to protect women’s assets and income in the event of a drought, even if the insurance holder does not directly manage livestock. This ‘Family Framing’ of the insurance product contrasts with the standard approach of focusing on the livestock-protection aspect of this kind of insurance. 

Half of the 410 savings groups in our sample will be randomly selected to receive this intervention.

All of the savings groups in the sample were initially conformed in the context of a previous poverty-graduation program (the REAP initiative carried out by BOMA, a local NGO), and the intervention will be delivered by community-based ‘facilitators’ who have previously worked in this prior BOMA Project intervention and speak the local language. Facilitators will make monthly visits to savings groups in the treatment arm between March and September when the IBLI sales window opens, and the product is available for purchase. On the first visit to treatment-arm groups facilitators will introduce the insurance product in its ‘Family Framing’ version, and will invite group members to start a new savings fund (operated within the structure of their savings group) meant to accumulate enough money to buy insurance on the next sales window. On each subsequent visit facilitators will provide general information on risk and risk-mitigation strategies, and specify the details of the insurance product being sold by Takaful Insurance of Africa (TIA), our partner insurance company. Groups in the control arm will be visited only twice (at the beginning and at the end of the intervention) and will be presented with the insurance product in its traditional ‘Livestock Framing’ version. Facilitators will not invite group members in the control arm to start an insurance-dedicated savings fund.

Additionally, all group members in both treatment and control arms will receive a subsidy covering a fraction of the price of the insurance product. On average 25% of women within each group will receive a ‘high’ subsidy covering 50% of the product’s total price, while the remaining 75% of group members will receive a ‘low’ subsidy covering 5% of the product’s price. The distribution of the subsidy coupons will be made at random during the facilitator’s first visit by drawing colored balls from a bag, so the actual share of high- and low-subsidy recipients in each group will vary randomly. 

We expect this intervention to increase insurance uptake rates by women belonging to savings groups in the savings arm. We plan to further investigate the effect of the intervention on women’s business assets, income level, total savings, and food security status one season after the purchase of insurance, comparing these outcomes both across insured and uninsured individuals and across households in regions affected and unaffected by drought. Specifically, food security status will be measured using, i) the number of days in a week the household’s children skipped dinner, and ii) the number of times in a day during the past week where children ate a meal. Information on all of these outcomes will be collected during a baseline survey carried out between March and April 2023 and during an endline survey collected between January and February 2024. Both surveys will be collected from 5 women in each savings group, yielding a sample of 2,050 individuals.

The number of members within each savings group varies between 6 and 21, with the average being 15. We thus expect to have insurance purchase information for nearly 6,500 individuals. Information on business assets, income, total savings, and food security will be collected from 5 women in each business group using a survey instrument based on the one previously used by BOMA to track the progress of their program. We expect to collect information on these outcomes from 2,050 individuals.

Half of the savings groups will be randomly assigned into either the treatment or the control arm. This randomization will be stratified at the facilitator level, ensuring that each facilitator is responsible for roughly the same number of groups in each arm. There will be a total of 25 facilitators across 5 counties (Garissa; Isiolo; Marsabit; Samburu; Turkana). Each facilitator will be responsible for a varying number of groups according to geographical proximity and local language requirements. Facilitators will make 5 visits to treatment groups between March and September providing information on risk-mitigation practices. Control groups will be visited only twice: once in March at the beginning of the intervention and once in September once the sales window opens. For both treatment and control groups the baseline survey will be collected between March and April 2023, and an endline survey will be collected between January and February 2024.

Control arm: Around 3,250 group members out of which1,025 will be surveyed, distributed across 205 clusters (savings groups).","We conduct power calculations using parameters estimated from data collected during a previous research intervention studying pastoralist households in Samburu county during the 2018-2021 period. We compute the mean and variance of all of our primary main outcomes (insurance purchases; assets; income; savings; food security) from this dataset, as well as the intra-cluster correlation coefficients calculated at the manyatta level (in our current study, there is almost always a single savings group per manyatta). 

Based on historical data on drought occurrences across the 5 pastoralist counties of our study, we spatially distributed our sample in such a way to maximize the probability of observing a drought shock in at least some of our clusters. We assume that roughly one third of the clusters in our sample will have a drought shock during the September-January 2023 rainy season, and therefore adjusted our sample size to have adequate statistical power so that we can explore the impact of the treatment on mitigating the impact of shocks. 

Based on the parameters obtained from the prior 2018-2021 Samburu-county intervention, and under the assumption that each treatment cluster (i.e. each savings group) is composed of 15 members, our study is powered to detect a 44% increase in insurance uptake (a 2 percentage-point increase above the observed 4.5% baseline uptake rate) with power of 0.8. 

For our remaining primary outcomes, we are assuming that out of the 410 treatment clusters in our sample, roughly 136 will have a drought shock during the September-January 2023 rainy season. Assuming as well that insurance uptake rates reach 6.5%, and taking this figure as our first-stage treatment compliance rate, our study is powered to detect (with a power of 0.8), a 3.5% increase in business income; a 4% increase in business assets; a 6.2% increase in total savings; a 2.2% increase in the household’s dietary diversity score, and a 6% impact on the number of days in which the family’s children skipped dinner.

Agrodealers assigned to the comparison group were given a list of all the varieties available in that region and stocked by the distributor. The list included the name of the variety, the year of release, and the wholesale price offered by the distributor. This list was then followed by a shorter list of all the newer varieties (introduced to the market in the last seven years). Shops assigned to the incentive group received the same lists as the comparison group. Additionally, the attention of shop owners in this group was drawn to 4 newly released varieties particularly agronomically suited to their region that were commercially available and promising in terms of performance but with a relatively low market share. The four varieties under promotion were: Pan3M-05, Duma 419, Haraka 101, and Tsavo WE 4141. The shop owner was invited to select two of these four varieties for which they would like to receive the incentive. The agro-dealers were promised a margin discount of about 10%  of the purchase price (50 KES ~ 0.37 USD) for every 2kg seed packet stocked for the two varieties they selected.  
The monetary incentive was only valid if an agro dealer purchased the promoted varieties from the distributor that we partnered with and only for the first 15 bales of each variety. This was done so that it was easy to verify whether an agro dealer purchased the promoted variety and to avoid stockpiling by the agrodealers. Agrodealers in both treatment and control groups were given the distributor's contacts through which they could call to place an order anytime during the season.  Additionally, we provided a contact of one of the field assistants who was hired to work closely with the distributor to ensure that the agrodealers who made orders received them on time.

With a mean of 130kg (standard deviation of 211 kg ), an ICC of 0.03, 100 markets with an average of 3 shops and 0.8 power, the minimum detectable effect for our study is 70kg, a 54% increase relative to the control mean. This is considered a modest to large effect according to Cohen’s D. However, we note that there may be power losses because our clusters are not equally sized. We try to minimize this by weighting our observations with the inverse of the cluster size. In addition, we note the wide range of our outcome variable (as well as some of the other outcome variables (sales and total volumes of seed stock). An inverse hyperbolic sin transformation  and winsorization of the outcome variable (s) will be considered during the estimations, and this will significantly improve our power","Name: JKUAT institutiinal Scientific and Ethics Review Committee

A short survey was then administered to each consenting farmer. Each farmer was then asked to pick a raffle that placed them in a certain treatment. Each farmer had an equal chance (1/4) of being in any of the four main groups: control, information only, info plus 10% discount group, and info plus 25% discount group. To accommodate the two sub-groups in the 10 and 25% groups, the probability for these groups was set at 1/8 for each sub-group. Therefore, the probability of a farmer falling in each group was: ¼ for the control and information groups and 1/8 for all the four discount sub-groups. To implement this, each raffle basket had 32 pieces of paper: 8 for the control, 8 for the information treatment, 4 for the information plus 10% discount on new varieties treatment, 4 for the information plus 10% discount on bundles treatment, 4 for the information plus 25% discount on new varieties treatment, 4 for the information plus 25% discount on bundles treatment. There was only one raffle box at each agro-dealer shop. Picked raffles were immediately returned to the box (after noting the treatment) so as to retain the 32 raffle pieces all the time and give each farmer an equal chance of belonging to the different treatments. A farmer was then shown a video corresponding to the treatment they had picked and then given a voucher which she went with to the shop. After the intervention, the farmer proceeded to the shop to purchase seeds.

A large non-profit organization in the area allows farmers to get their Hass avocado crops certified ahead of the avocado season. Upon receiving certification, farmers enter into an agreement with the NGO, which ensures that the NGO will purchase their avocados at a higher price. The NGO then exports these Hass avocados to Europe. We partnered with this NGO to estimate the direct and indicret impact of this certification program. We are interested in estimating the differences in prices, revenue and profits between (i) farmers with and without certification, and (ii) uncertified farmers in areas with certification compared to those in areas without certification. We propose that the certification program could be boosting the earnings of all avocado growers in the Mount Kenya region - not solely those with certification. Our identification strategy relies on the fact that the latest expansion of the certification program was carried out randomly at the subcounty level.




 ",,,,2023-03-01,2023-06-29,"A prominent NGO in the Mount Kenya region provides a certification program to farmers growing Hass avocados. If a farmer gets certified, which requires some basic modifications in farm organization and hygiene practices, they can sell their Hass avocado yield to the NGO at a higher price. This certification initiative began in 2022 in 9 sub-counties around Mount Kenya, and the NGO is gradually broadening the locations offering certification. The most recent expansion of the program was conducted randomly at the sub-county level, which allows us to determine the causal impact of the certification program. We evaluate two types of effects, direct and indirect, by comparing:
(i) Certified and non-certified farmers (Direct Impact);
(ii) Non-certified farmers in areas with and without certification (Indirect Impact).
Our research focuses on three variables: the price farmers charge for avocados, avocado revenue, and avocado profits. We propose that the certification program may increase avocado prices in the region, both in sub-counties where certification is available and in those where it is not. Furthermore, we believe that all avocado varieties (Hass, Fuerte and local varieties) in the region might see a price rise.
","Avocado prices, avocado revenue (prices times quantity), and avocado profits (revenue minus costs of production). We will estimate these outcome variables for all farmers we survey and for all varieties of avocado (Hass, Fuerte and local varieties).",,"We are also interested in brokers activity in the region. So, we will also work with the variables: prices offered by brokers, frequency of brokers visit, and number of different brokers. ",,"In partnership with a large NGO that operates in the Mount Kenya region, we randomize the expansion of a certification program for Hass avocado farmers at the sub-county level. In treated sub-counties, farmers growing Hass avocados can join the certification program, which calls for some elementary changes in farm organization and cleanliness measures. After obtaining certification, these farmers can sell their Hass avocados to the NGO at a price above the regular market rate. We compare these treated farmers with three types of farmers:
(i) Uncertified farmers based in sub-counties where there is certification (control group 1). These are also non-elegible for certification;
(ii) Uncertified farmers who are elegible for certification but are based in sub-counties where the NGO does not offer certification (control group 2);
(iii) Uncertified farmers who are not elegible for certification and are based in sub-counties where the NGO does not offer certification (control group 3).
We then estimate direct impact comparing certified farmers with control group 2; and spillover impact comparing control groups 1 and 3. We focus on three variables of interest: average avocado prices, avocado revenue, and avocado profit. These are measured for the most important varieties of avocado in the region: Hass, Fuerte and local varieties.

All seed pack distributions were also accompanied by signs/varietal posters where the participating farmers were encouraged to display in the experimental plots. 

Our study design will inform decisions concerning the proportion of farmers in a given area/region seed companies and other stakeholders should be distributing seed trial packs to and whether incentives are necessary to promote experimentation. These are important decisions given that scale directly affects marketing budgets for new varieties. Our work will measure the impacts of alternative promotion models on outcomes of interest at the farmer- and village-level, including awareness of new varieties, perceptions and beliefs about new varieties, demand and willingness to pay for new varieties.","•	Willingness to experiment with new varieties
•	Varietal switching – from old well known to newer varieties. Measured as 1) Proportion of planted varieties that are new, 2) Proportion of maize area cultivated with new varieties, and 3) Weighted average age of varieties planted by a household.
•	Awareness and exposure to the specific varieties used in the study (experimental varieties)
",,"•	Adherence to experimental recommendations (for trial hosts in treated villages)
•	trial hosts dissemination of experimental process and results
•	Perceptions about new varieties (vis-à-vis old known ones) on performance, quality and production costs
•	Expected yield distributions for new varieties vis-à-vis established ones (status quo) ",,"Our treatments vary at cluster/village level. Treatments are defined at the village-level in order to evaluate village-level effects on awareness, perception and demand for experimental varieties.  Our experimental design includes a control group and three treatment arms as defined below:
    1) T1: Light treatment – this involves low saturation in terms of the proportion of farmers hosting the trials in a village. We endorsed 10% saturation level for this treatment arm. The randomly selected hosts were given 0.5kg of seeds to experiment with. 
    2) T2: Light treatment + incentives – we layer incentives to host farmers on top of T1. The hypothesis here is that incentivizing host farmers could encourage them to share information among their counterparts, which could then improve the effectiveness of trial packs model, even with low concentration. For the incentives, we are sending Ksh 1500 (approx. USD 11) to host farmers under this treatment arm in three instalments of equal amount. 
    3) T3: Heavy treatment – this involves high saturation of trial hosts in a village where 35% of households in a village host the trials of 0.5kg of seeds.
    4) T0: Control – this is a comparison group where no intervention will be implemented. 
",,Randomization was done in the office by the researchers using Stata. ,We employed cluster level randomization where treatments were assigned at village level,208 villages,"4,160 households","52 clusters control, 52 clusters treatment1 (low saturation), 52 clusters treatment2 (low saturation plus incentives), and 52 clusters treatment3 (high saturation)","Since we do not have data on outcomes of interest in our target population, our power calculations require assumptions.  If we want to be able to compare each treatment against the control, as well as compare treatments against one another, then we maximize power by making each group the same size. This means that with a total of 208 candidate villages, we can work with 4 groups (1 control and 3 treatment arms) of 52 villages each. If we want to use the likelihood of purchasing a new variety in any given year as the basis for power analysis, we have no data on this, so we must assume some distributional characteristics. 

To begin with, let us assume that 10% of HHs are switchers, or do purchase a new maize variety in any given year. With a fixed number of clusters, we then examine the number of households required for data collection in each village to detect a treatment-induced change from that 10%, assuming that the intra-cluster correlation is 0.2 and standard levels of acceptable type I and II errors (i.e., alpha = 0.05 and power of 80%, using a one-sided test). 

We first consider an analysis of spillover effect among non-hosts that compares T1 (the lightest treatment) to the control group. Assuming baseline/control outcome of 10% switchers and MDE of 0.086 or 8.6 percentage points increase in uptake of new varieties among the treatment villages, we need 16 households per village. For the analysis of trial-hosts outcomes, one can assume a higher MDE since they receive the treatment directly (heavier treatment). With 52 clusters and MDE of 0.112 or 11.2 percentage points increase in uptake of new varieties among the hosts in treatment villages, we need 4 host households interviewed per village. These results are shown in Figure 1 below.

For an analysis that compares treatment groups among each other, we assume T1 as the comparison group for T2 and T3, and assume that, after the intervention, 20% of T1 will be switchers. Assuming equal sample size across experimental groups, we shall be able to detect an MDE of 0.106 (10.6 percentage points) with 16 non-host households surveyed and 0.137 (13.7 percentage points) with 4 hosts households surveyed.

Agricultural information crowdsourcing initiatives can influence decision making and behavior. Recent efforts use such initiatives to dynamically monitor shocks and inform early warning and anticipatory action. The relevance of such information depends on the ability to reach the target audience (in our case, the pastoralists) in a timely manner. This requires dissemination of the information. While there has been considerable effort to collect crowdsourced information, very little attention has been placed on its dissemination for decision making. Therefore, knowledge on the access, use, and effect of such information is inadequate. This knowledge gap makes it difficult to conclude whether and the extent to which agricultural information crowdsourcing initiatives are beneficial. This study, implemented within a pastoralist setting, attempts to fill this gap by conducting a cluster-randomized controlled trial (cluster RCT) to assess access and use of livestock information collected via the KAZNET initiative. The study further assesses the welfare effects of the KAZNET livestock information crowdsourcing initiative and probes the mechanisms through which such effects occur. The RCT randomizes 200 villages into one treatment arm and one control arm. The treatment arm is assigned to receive KAZNET livestock information via a mobile phone dashboard. The control arm is not signed up to receive KAZNET livestock information. Within each village, we target pastoralist groups/associations for the KAZNET livestock information diffusion.",,,,2023-11-01,2024-09-30,"The study design is a cluster-randomized controlled trial. We will randomize 200 villages into one treatment arm and one control. We will work with 24 “contributors” to sign-up the treatment arm for crowdsourced KAZNET information about the performance of livestock markets, rangeland conditions, livestock mortality and the associated causes, and milk production. The target sample includes pastoralists groups within the selected villages. We will use a minimum distance rule for the selection of villages; for example, any two villages in the sample must be a minimum of 5 km apart. While we cannot rule out that people who live in different villages may still talk to each other, imposing a minimum distance reduces the likelihood that people will belong to more than one group in our sample or observe the behavior or practices of those in another village. All pastoralist groups in a village belong to either the treatment arm (T1) or control (T0). In each pastoralist group, five individuals will be recruited into the study. In the treatment arm, the KAZNET crowdsourcing approach will be explained. Pastoralists will be informed about the process of data collection and the information that is available for dissemination. Individuals with smartphones will be asked if they would be willing to sign-up to receive information on their smartphones. Those expressing interest will be registered on the KAZNET app for information access. Pastoralist groups in the control villages will not receive any information about KAZNET and will not be provided the opportunity to sign-up for KAZNET information.","Our main outcome variables measure (1) household dietary diversity score, (2) months of food self-sufficiency, and (3) reduced coping strategy index.",Household dietary diversity score (HDDS) will be measured using 24 hour recall data on the consumption of different food groups; months of food self sufficiency is a summation of all months in the last 12 months when the household had enough food to eat; reduced coping strategy index is a score used to compare the hardship faced by households due to a shortage of food. The index measures the frequency and severity of the food consumption behaviors the households had to engage in due to food shortage in the 7 days prior to the survey. ,"KAZNET was mentioned as a source of information on livestock markets and forage conditions, perceived usefulness of KAZNET information, trust in KAZNET data, number of people with whom the respondent discusses about markets and forage conditions, changing selling markets, selling livestock in markets with better prices, and purchasing and storing fodder, price knowledge, we look at the ability or willingness to report a price by livestock type and market, inputs expenditure, livestock selling price, livestock mortality, and income.","First, exposure to KAZNET crowdsourced livestock information can increase trust and influence the use of such information. We check whether KAZNET was mentioned as a source of information on livestock markets and forage conditions. We further test the effect of our intervention on the perceived usefulness of KAZNET information. Respondents will be asked to indicate on a scale of 0 (not useful at all) to 10 (very useful) the extent to which KAZNET information was useful to the livestock activities of their households. We also assess trust in KAZNET data. Respondents will be asked to indicate on a scale of 0 (no trust at all) to 10 (complete trust) the extent to which they trust that KAZNET information is accurate for the livestock activities of their households.

Second, we hypothesize that KAZNET information can influence behavior. Specifically, we test the effect of our intervention on the number of people with whom the respondent discusses about markets and forage conditions, the likelihood of changing selling markets, the likelihood of selling livestock in markets with better prices, and the likelihood of purchasing and storing fodder.

Third, KAZNET information can increase the knowledge of pastoralists. We focus on price knowledge and test the effect of exposure to KAZNET on the absolute value of the difference between respondent’s reported per animal price from the price sent the week the survey was carried out, in the respective unit areas of insurance. In addition, we look at the ability or willingness to report a price by livestock type and market. Specifically, we ask respondents, “If you were to sell your [livestock type] today, what would be the selling price?”. We hypothesize that pastoralists exposed to KAZNET would negotiate better for their livestock compared to their counterparts in the control group.

Fourth, access to KAZNET information can crowd-in investment in productivity-enhancing inputs and encourage commercialization of livestock production. Further, through its influence on herd management, exposure to KAZNET is expected to reduce livestock mortality. Therefore, we test the effect of our intervention on inputs expenditure, livestock selling price, livestock mortality, and income.","The study design is a cluster-randomized controlled trial.

",,,,2023-10-01,2023-12-01,,"- Measures policy note quality.
- Measures of intended engagement with the policy note. 
- Measures of beliefs about peers’ assessment of quality and intended engagement. 
","Outcome 1: Quality measures
Perceived quality will follow measures from Fillol et al. (2022). The measures are based on five criteria: 
1.	Credibility: “the perceived quality, validity and scientific adequacy of the people, processes and knowledge exchanged” through the policy note (Balian et al., 2016)
2.	Legitimacy: “the perceived fairness and balance” of the policy note (Balian et al., 2016)
3.	Relevance: “the salience and responsiveness of the [policy note] to policy and societal needs (Balian et al., 2016)
4.	Comprehension: the clarity and ease of understanding of the policy note, particularly with respect to the policy recommendations 
5.	Visual aspect: the visual appearance of the policy note in terms of ascetics, structure, and length
Before the respondent reads the policy note, ten questions are asked about the importance of aspects related to these criteria. These questions serve two purposes. First, they allow us to measure what aspects of policy notes are important to the respondents, which is a useful descriptive insight. Second, they allow us to use weighted scores as a main outcome measure. 
After the respondent reads the policy note, ten questions (analogous to the ten asked above) across these five dimensions are asked in the survey to judge the quality of the policy note. Each question uses a five-point Likert scale. 
The main outcomes variables will be unweighted and weighted averages of the scores. The weights will be derived from the relative importance of each characteristic as reported by each respondent.  Secondary outcomes will be individual measures of each dimension. 
Outcome 2: Intended engagement measures
The survey will ask respondents how likely they are to do the following using a five-point Likert scale:
1.	Share the policy note with others
2.	Re-read the policy note
3.	Lookup the studies cited in the policy note
4.	Lookup studies related to the policy note
5.	Contact the researchers who wrote the policy note (if their name and contact information are provided) 
The main outcome will be an aggregated index (to correct for multiple hypothesis testing). Anderson q-values or the “average effect”  will be considered.
Outcome 3: Measures of beliefs of others’ assessment of quality and engagement
The survey tells the respondents to think about all other people in their country with similar position levels and in similar institutions, and asks them how such peers will rate the policy note on a five point Likert scale in terms of:
1.	Overall quality of the policy note (i.e. the average score across the ten quality questions)
2.	How likely they are to share the policy note with others 
3.	How likely they are to re-read the policy note
4.	How likely they are to lookup the studies cited in the policy note
5.	How likely they are to lookup studies related to the policy note
6.	How likely they are to contact the researchers who wrote the policy note (if their name and contact information are provided) 
The main outcomes will be a measure of beliefs about others’ assessment of the overall quality of the policy note and an average of the responses related to others’ engagement with the policy note. A secondary outcome will be the individual responses to each of the five questions related to engagement. 
The incentives for the survey will be derived from these questions. An average of the 6 questions will be taken for each respondent. This average will then be compared to the average responses that their peers (defined by country-gender-seniority) gave. The incentives serve two purposes: 1) to get more accurate estimates of peoples’ beliefs and 2) to potentially increase response rates by making incentives merit-based rather than randomly given.

One such form of information is agricultural information, but there is limited rigorous evidence on the effect of extension delivered via television on agricultural outcomes, such as investment or productivity. Moreover, while television can provide easy access to information, its impact on agricultural investment may be constrained by other barriers, such as market access. We implement a cross-randomized experiment to simultaneously address information and market access constraints. We will evaluate a new farm makeover show broadcast on national TV in Zambia called “Munda Make Over”, modeled after the popular Kenyan show “Shamba Shape Up”. The show is similar to home makeover shows in developed countries, featuring visits by an expert who tours the farm, points out areas for improvement, and implements their advice, with segments dedicated to gender issues interspersed throughout the season. To address market access, we simultaneously cross-randomize “road shows”, locally-held events in which providers make their products and services available for sale closer to where farmers live, addressing barriers to market access.

The experimental design involves a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to assess the impact of the Tharaka Nithi County Preschool Program on child development and women's labor supply. The intervention targets 3–4-year-olds, utilizing the existing infrastructure of PP1 (pre-primary 1) in selected public schools. The study duration is planned for two years, starting in the school calendar year beginning January 2023.


We will select 117 schools in Tharaka Nithi county in Kenya based on: a) their ability to accommodate 5 extra children in their preschool class (PP1 - currently for four year-olds only); b) that do not have a playgroup for children younger than 4; c) do not admit regularly 3-year-olds. 

Determining the 3-year olds that will participate in the study: Following a census we consider all 3-year-olds defined as children who will be between 2y8mo-3y6mo in January 2024. We then allocate 10 children and 5 reserve children to the closest possible school of the 117 study schools such that each school is associated with 10 children and five reserve children to fill in the place of those who turn down participation in the study.

We then randomly select 60 schools into treatment. For each treatment school we randomly select 5 children from the group associated with the school (as above) to attend to attend the school. The other five will be controls. Children associated with control schools are also controls. Once parents have consented, these children are assessed, and household data is collected.


4-year-olds attend preschool (PP1) anyway: This is the current age of first attendance. Thus, once school has started in January 2024 we obtain the register of all 4-year-old children in all 117 study schools. We then randomly pick 5 4-year-olds from the list to be the children we observe for the study. Once parents have consented, these children are assessed, and household data is collected.

An estimated 43% of children under age 5 in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) experience compromised development due to poverty, poor nutrition, and inadequate psychosocial stimulation. Numerous early childhood development (ECD) parenting interventions have been shown to be effective at improving ECD outcomes, at least in the short-term, but they are a) still too expensive to implement at scale in low-resource and rural settings, and b) their early impacts tend to fade over time in the absence of continued support. New ways to deliver effective ECD parenting interventions are sorely needed that are both low-cost to be potentially scalable, while also able to sustain impacts long-term.

Methods
Our proposed study experimentally tests a traditional in-person group-based delivery model for an evidence-based ECD parenting intervention against a delivery model that partially substitutes remote (mHealth) delivery for in-person meetings. We will assess the relative effectiveness and costs of this hybrid-delivery model against purely in-person delivery and will extend the interventions over two years to increase their ability to sustain changes in child outcomes longer-term. Our evaluation design is a clustered Randomized Control Trial across 90 villages and 1200 households. We hypothesize that a hybrid-delivery ECD intervention will be lower cost, but remote interactions among participants may be an inferior substitute for in-person visits, leaving open the question of the most cost-effective program. 

Discussion:
Our goal is to determine the best model to maximize the intervention’s reach and sustained impacts to improve child outcomes. By integrating delivery into the ongoing operations of local community health workers within Kenya’s rural health care system, and utilizing new low-cost technology, our project has the potential to make important contributions towards discovering potentially scalable, sustainable solutions for resource-limited settings.",,,,2024-01-22,2024-09-13,,"Child cognition, Parenting behaviors",,,,Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial,,Randomization done in office by a computer using STATA SE 18,Village,90 villages,1200 households ,"30 control villages, 30 in-person group-delivery treatment villages, 30 hybrid-delivery treatment villages",,"Name: University of Southern California Institutional Review Board

One explanation is that learning about new varieties through experimentation is risky, as newer varieties can be more expensive, and farmers may be unsure of how these varieties will perform on their land. As self-consumption is also prevalent, households may face additional consumption-related risks when producing a new variety, such as dislike of the taste. In this project, we compare interventions that address production-side risks (free seed trial packs) and consumption-side risks (free samples of the same variety's end-product, and a cooking demonstration) to adoption of new varieties.

Consumption Risk Intervention: Farmers will be given a ``free sample'' of the crop itself rather than of the seeds of the crop. Similarly to with the trial pack, the sample is only intended to allow families to learn about the taste and consumption attributes of the new variety without having to necessarily invest in cultivating or purchasing the variety. In practice, the samples in question usually constitute enough to make 1-3 meals for the household, with some variation between settings. In some country sites, tasting experimentation was facilitated in a formal setting with individuals or groups, guided by enumerators.
